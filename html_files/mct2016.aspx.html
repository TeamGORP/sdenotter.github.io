casualty companies) to maintain adequate capital. Subsection 608(1) of the <em>ICA</em> requires foreign property and casualty companies operating in Canada on a branch basis (foreign property and casualty companies) to maintain an adequate margin of assets in Canada over liabilities in Canada. The Minimum Capital Test (MCT) Guideline is not made pursuant to subsections 515(2) and 608(3) of the <em>Act</em>. However, the minimum and supervisory target capital standards set out in this guideline provide the framework within which the Superintendent assesses whether a property and casualty company maintains adequate capital pursuant to subsection 515(1) and whether a foreign property and casualty company maintains an adequate margin pursuant to subsection 608(1). Notwithstanding that a property and casualty company may meet these standards, the Superintendent may direct the property and casualty company to increase its capital under subsection 515(3) or the foreign property and casualty company to increase the margin of assets in Canada over liabilities in Canada under subsection 608(4).</p>\r\n<p>This guideline outlines the capital framework, using a risk-based formula, for target and minimum capital/margin required, and defines the capital/assets that are available to meet the minimum standard. The MCT determines the minimum capital/margin required and not the level of capital/margin required at which property and casualty companies must operate.</p>\r\n<p>Foreign property and casualty companies are reminded that the MCT is only one element in the determination of the required assets that must be maintained in Canada by foreign property and casualty companies. Foreign property and casualty companies must vest assets in accordance with the Adequacy of Assets in Canada test as prescribed in the <em>Assets (Foreign Companies) Regulations.</em></p>\r\n<div class="span-4 module-table-contents">\r\n  <h2>Table of Contents</h2>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li><a href="#Toc-1"><strong>Chapter 1.

Overview and General Requirements</h2>\r\n<p>The Minimum Capital Test (MCT) Guideline applies to Canadian property and casualty insurance companies and foreign property and casualty companies operating in Canada on a branch basis, collectively referred to as P&amp;C insurers. Chapter 3 of this guideline, <em>Foreign Companies Operating in Canada on a Branch Basis,</em> defines assets available for foreign property and casualty companies operating in Canada on a branch basis (foreign companies). The MCT Guideline uses generic expressions that are meant to apply to both Canadian P&amp;C insurers and foreign companies; e.g., capital available also refers to assets available for Branch Adequacy of Assets Test (BAAT) purposes, capital required refers to margin required for BAAT purposes and capital adequacy refers to margin adequacy for BAAT purposes.</p>\r\n<p>This chapter provides an overview of the MCT Guideline and sets out general requirements. More detailed information on specific components of the capital test is contained under subsequent chapters.</p>\r\n<p>Further guidance concerning some of the requirements of the MCT Guideline may be found in other guidelines and advisories available on OSFI\'s website under the Property and Casualty Insurance Companies section.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li> <a href="/Eng/fi-if/rg-ro/gdn-ort/gl-ld/Pages/default.aspx">Table of OSFI Guidelines</a></li>\r\n  <li> <a href="/Eng/fi-if/rg-ro/gdn-ort/gl-ld/Pages/default.aspx#cpt">Guidelines and Related Advisories \xe2\x80\x93 Capital</a></li>\r\n  <li> <a href="/Eng/fi-if/app/rla-prl/Pages/default.aspx">Regulatory and Legislative Advisories</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 id="Toc-1.1">1.1. Overview</h3>\r\n<h4><em>1.1.1. Minimum and target capital requirements under the MCT</em></h4>\r\n<p>Under the MCT, regulatory capital requirements for various risks are set directly at a pre-determined target confidence level. OSFI has elected 99% of the expected shortfall (conditional tail expectation or CTE 99%) over a one-year time horizon as a target confidence level.<sup id="fnb1-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb1"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>1</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>The risk factors defined in this guideline are used to compute capital requirements at the target level. The resulting MCT capital requirements are then divided by 1.5 to derive the minimum capital requirements. The MCT ratio is expressed as the capital available over the minimum capital required.</p>\r\n<h4><em>1.1.2. Risk-based capital adequacy </em></h4>\r\n<p>P&amp;C insurers are required to meet the MCT capital requirements at all times. The definition of capital available to be used for this purpose is described in chapter 2 and includes qualifying criteria for capital instruments, capital composition limits, and regulatory adjustments and deductions. The definition encompasses capital available within all subsidiaries that are consolidated for the purpose of calculating the MCT ratio.</p>\r\n<p>P&amp;C insurers\' minimum capital requirements are calculated on a consolidated basis and determined as the sum of the capital requirements at the target level for each risk component, less the diversification credit, divided by 1.5.</p>\r\n<p>The minimum capital requirements are calculated as follows:</p>\r\n<p><em>Sum of:</em></p>\r\n<ol class="list-lower-roman">\r\n  <li>Capital required for insurance risk (reference chapter 4):\r\n    <ol class="list-lower-alpha">\r\n      <li>Capital required for unpaid claims and premium liabilities;</li>\r\n      <li>Catastrophe reserves;</li>\r\n      <li>Margin required for reinsurance ceded to unregistered reinsurers.</li>\r\n    </ol>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>Capital required for market risk (reference chapter 5):\r\n    <ol class="list-lower-alpha">\r\n      <li>Capital required for interest rate risk;</li>\r\n      <li>Capital required for foreign exchange risk;</li>\r\n      <li>Capital required for equity risk;</li>\r\n      <li>Capital required for real estate risk;</li>\r\n      <li>Capital required for other market risk exposures.</li>\r\n    </ol>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>Capital required for credit risk (reference chapter 6):\r\n    <ol class="list-lower-alpha">\r\n      <li>Capital required for counterparty default risk for balance sheet assets;</li>\r\n      <li>Capital required for counterparty default risk for off-balance sheet exposures;</li>\r\n      <li>Capital required for collateral held for unregistered reinsurance and self-insured retention (reference section 4.3.3). </li>\r\n    </ol>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>Capital required for operational risk (reference chapter 7).</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><em>Less:</em></p>\r\n<ol class="list-lower-roman" start="5">\r\n  <li>Diversification credit (reference chapter 8). </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><em>Divided by 1.5.</em></p>\r\n<h4><em>1.1.3. Scope of consolidation</em></h4>\r\n<p>The capital adequacy requirements apply on a consolidated basis. The consolidated entity includes the P&amp;C insurer and all of its directly or indirectly held subsidiaries, which carry on business that the parent could carry on directly in accordance with the <em>Insurance Companies Act</em> (ICA), including holding companies (e.g. P&amp;C insurance and ancillary businesses such as agencies, brokerages and mutual funds). It therefore excludes:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>life insurance subsidiaries,</li>\r\n  <li>other regulated financial institutions carrying on business that the parent would not be permitted to carry on directly under the <em>Insurance Companies Act</em> (ICA). </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Whether a subsidiary should be consolidated is determined by the nature of the subsidiary\'s business (i.e. whether it carries on business related to P&amp;C insurance), not the location where the subsidiary conducts its business (e.g. a U.S. P&amp;C insurance subsidiary). All other interests in subsidiaries are considered &quot;non-qualifying&quot; for capital purposes and are excluded from capital available and capital required calculations.</p>\r\n<h4><em>1.1.4. Foreign companies</em></h4>\r\n<p>The margin requirement for foreign companies is set forth under the BAAT in chapter 3. The BAAT covers each of the risk components, and is determined using risk factors and other methods that are applied to assets under the control of the Superintendent, to specific assets under the control of the Chief Agent, and to liabilities in Canada.</p>\r\n<p>The BAAT is only one element in the determination of the required assets that must be maintained in Canada by foreign companies. Foreign companies must vest assets in accordance with the Adequacy of Assets in Canada test, as prescribed in the <em>Assets (Foreign Companies) Regulations.</em></p>\r\n<h4><em>1.1.5. Interpretation of results</em></h4>\r\n<p>The MCT is a standardized measure of capital adequacy of a P&amp;C insurer. It is one of several indicators that OSFI uses to assess an insurer\'s financial condition and should not be used in isolation for ranking and rating insurers.</p>\r\n<h3 id="Toc-1.2">1.2. General Requirements</h3>\r\n<h4><em>1.2.1. MCT supervisory capital ratio for federally regulated P&amp;C insurers</em></h4>\r\n<p>The MCT ratio is expressed as a percentage and is calculated by dividing the P&amp;C insurer\'s capital available by minimum capital required, which is derived from capital required calculated at the target level for specific risks.</p>\r\n<p>Federally regulated P&amp;C insurers are required, at a minimum, to maintain an MCT ratio of 100%. OSFI has established an industry-wide supervisory target capital ratio (supervisory target) of 150% that provides a cushion above the minimum requirement and facilitates OSFI\'s early intervention process. The supervisory target provides additional capacity to absorb unexpected losses and addresses capital needs through on-going market access.</p>\r\n<p>OSFI expects each P&amp;C insurer to establish an internal target capital ratio (internal target) per Guideline A-4 <em>Regulatory Capital and Internal Capital Targets</em>, and maintain on-going capital, above this target. However, the Superintendent may, on a case-by-case basis, establish an alternative supervisory target (in consultation with a P&amp;C insurer) based upon the P&amp;C insurer\'s individual risk profile.</p>\r\n<p>P&amp;C insurers are required to inform OSFI immediately if they anticipate falling below their internal target and to lay out their plans, for OSFI\'s supervisory approval, to return to their internal target. OSFI will consider any unusual conditions in the market environment when evaluating P&amp;C insurers\' performance against their internal targets.</p>\r\n<p>P&amp;C insurers are expected to maintain their MCT ratios at or above their established internal targets on a continuous basis. Questions about an individual P&amp;C insurer\'s target ratio should be addressed to the Relationship Manager at OSFI.</p>\r\n<h4><em>1.2.2. Audit requirement</em></h4>\r\n<p>P&amp;C insurers are required to engage their auditor appointed pursuant to section 337 or 633 of theICA to report annually on the MCT or BAAT prepared as at fiscal year-end, in accordance with the relevant standards for such assurance engagements, as promulgated by the Canadian Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (AASB).</p>\r\n<p>The annual audit report of the MCT or BAAT must be prepared separately from the audit report for the financial statements, and is to be filed no later than 90 days after the P&amp;C insurers\' fiscal year-end. The annual audit opinion provided must be with respect to the current fiscal year-end, for page 30.61 of the P&amp;C quarterly return.</p>\r\n<h4><em>1.2.3. Transitional arrangements</em></h4>\r\n<p>P&amp;C insurers are required to phase-in the capital impact of the revised MCT framework. The phase-in should be done on a straight-line basis, over twelve quarters, starting with the first quarter ending in 2015.</p>\r\n<p>The capital impacts to be phased-in must be computed separately for capital available and capital required. The net capital impact is equal to the difference between capital available (old framework versus new framework) and minimum capital required (old framework versus new framework). In order to do so, P&amp;C insurers are required to calculate two sets of MCT requirements as at December 31, 2014 (or October 31, 2014): one under the old framework, and another one under the new framework. The MCT requirements under the old framework are the same as those prepared and filed with OSFI for regulatory compliance purposes. The MCT requirements under the new framework as at December 31, 2014 (or October 31, 2014) do not need to be filed with OSFI.</p>\r\n<p>In order to ensure that all companies are treated equally, the phase-in is mandatory for all insurers whether they are affected positively or negatively.</p>\r\n<p>For example, a P&amp;C insurer with a December 31 year-end must file with OSFI its MCT as at December 31, 2014 under the old framework and must calculate an additional MCT under the new framework as at the same date. The difference in capital available and the difference in capital required are the capital impacts to be amortized evenly over the next twelve quarters. The amortization of capital available and capital required impact amounts must be reported each quarter until December 31, 2017. Insurers with an October 31 year-end must calculate the capital impacts (old versus new) as at October 31, 2014. The amortization of capital available and capital required amounts must be reported each quarter until October 31, 2017.</p>\r\n<p>The phase-in amounts for capital available and capital required are a one-time impact based on December 31, 2014 (or October 31, 2014) which will uniformly unwind to zero over the next twelve quarters and are to be calculated using the following formulae:</p>\r\n<div class="margin-top-medium margin-bottom-medium border-all">\r\n  <p><em>Phased-in Capital Available = Capital Available under the New MCT - </em>n<em>/12 x (Capital Available under the New MCT at December 31, 2014 \xe2\x80\x93 Capital Available under the old MCT at December 31, 2014)</em></p>\r\n  <p>Where <em>n</em> declines from 11 in the first quarter 2015 to 0 in the fourth quarter 2017</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="margin-top-medium margin-bottom-medium border-all">\r\n  <p><em>Phased-in Capital Required = Capital Required under the New MCT - </em>n<em>/12 x (Capital Required under the New MCT at December 31, 2014 \xe2\x80\x93 Capital Required under the old MCT at December 31, 2014)</em></p>\r\n  <p>Where <em>n</em> declines from 11 in the first quarter 2015 to 0 in the fourth quarter 2017</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p><strong>Equity Derivatives, Common Shares Held Short and Eligible  Hedges</strong></p>\r\n<p>P&amp;C insurers are required to phase-in the  capital impact of the capital treatment for equity derivatives (futures,  forwards, and swaps), common shares held short and eligible hedges that are  already in place at the time of issuance of this guideline whether the capital  impact is positive or negative.\xc2\xa0 The capital  impact should be phased-in over eight quarters starting with the first quarter  ending in 2016.</p>\r\n<p>The capital impact is equal to the market risk capital treatment for  equity derivatives, common shares held short and eligible hedges as per section  5.3 and must be calculated and reported at the end of each quarter.\xc2\xa0 Therefore, the capital impact to be phased-in  will vary by quarter.\xc2\xa0 The capital impact  must be phased-in using 1/8 of the new capital charge (or credit) in the first  quarter 2016 increasing to 8/8 or full recognition in the fourth quarter 2017  (the end of the phase-in period will be October 31, 2017 for insurers with an  October 31year-end).</p>\r\n<div class="margin-top-medium margin-bottom-medium border-all">\r\n  <p><em>Phase-in = Capital Required for Market  Risk for equity derivatives, common shares held short and eligible hedges as at  the quarter end x </em>n<em>/</em>8</p>\r\n  <p>Where <em>n</em> increases from 1 in  the first quarter 2016 to 8 in the fourth quarter 2017</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2 id="Toc-2">Chapter 2. Definition of Capital Available</h2>\r\n<p>This chapter establishes requirements for the adequacy and appropriateness of capital resources used to meet capital requirements, having regard to their ability to meet P&amp;C insurers\' obligations to policyholders and creditors and to absorb losses in periods of stress. This includes the determination of the criteria for assessing the quality of capital components for inclusion in capital available and the composition of capital available for regulatory purposes, focussing on the predominance of highest quality capital.</p>\r\n<h3 id="Toc-2.1">2.1. Summary of Capital Components</h3>\r\n<p>The four primary considerations for defining the capital available of a company for the purpose of measuring capital adequacy are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>availability: the extent to which the capital element is fully paid in and available to absorb losses;</li>\r\n  <li>permanence: the period for, and extent to which, the capital element is available;</li>\r\n  <li>absence of encumbrances and mandatory servicing costs: the extent to which the capital element is free from mandatory payments or encumbrances; and</li>\r\n  <li>subordination: the extent to which and the circumstances under which the capital element is subordinated to the rights of policyholders and creditors of the insurer in an insolvency or winding-up.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Regulatory capital available will consist of the sum of the following components: common equity or category A capital, category B capital, and category C capital.</p>\r\n<h4><em>2.1.1. Category A capital (i.e. common equity ) </em></h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Common shares issued by the P&amp;C insurer that meet the category A qualifying criteria as described below;</li>\r\n  <li>Surplus (share premium) resulting from the issuance of instruments included in common equity capital and other contributed surplus<sup id="fnb2-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb2"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>2</a></sup>;</li>\r\n  <li>Retained earnings;</li>\r\n  <li>Earthquake, nuclear and general contingency reserves; and</li>\r\n  <li>Accumulated other comprehensive income.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income include interim profit or loss. Dividends are removed from capital available in accordance with applicable accounting standards.</p>\r\n<p><em>2.1.1.1. Qualifying criteria for inclusion of capital instruments in category A for regulatory capital purposes<sup id="fnb3-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb3"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>3</a></sup></em></p>\r\n<p>For an instrument to be included in capital available under category A, it must meet <strong>all</strong> of the following criteria:</p>\r\n<ol type="1" start="1">\r\n  <li>Represents the most subordinated claim in liquidation of the insurer.</li>\r\n  <li>The investor is entitled to a claim on the residual assets that is proportional with its share of issued capital, after all senior claims have been paid in liquidation (i.e. has an unlimited and variable claim, not a fixed or capped claim).</li>\r\n  <li>The principal is perpetual and never repaid outside of liquidation (setting aside discretionary repurchases or other means of effectively reducing capital in a discretionary manner that is allowable under relevant law and subject to the prior approval of the Superintendent).</li>\r\n  <li>The insurer does not, in the sale or marketing of the instrument, create an expectation at issuance that the instrument will be bought back, redeemed or cancelled, nor do the statutory or contractual terms provide any feature that might give rise to such expectation.</li>\r\n  <li>Distributions are paid out of distributable items (retained earnings included). The level of distributions is not in any way tied or linked to the amount paid in at issuance and is not subject to a contractual cap (except to the extent that an insurer is unable to pay distributions that exceed the level of distributable items or to the extent that distribution on senior ranking capital must be paid first).</li>\r\n  <li>There are no circumstances under which the distributions are obligatory. Non-payment is, therefore, not an event of default.</li>\r\n  <li>Distributions are paid only after all legal and contractual obligations have been met and payments on more senior capital instruments have been made. This means that there are no preferential distributions, including in respect of other elements classified as the highest quality issued capital.</li>\r\n  <li>It is in the form of issued capital that takes the first and proportionately greatest share of any losses as they occur.

Amortization</em></p>\r\n<p>Category C capital instruments are subject to straight-line amortization in the final five years prior to maturity. Hence, as these instruments approach maturity, redemption or retraction, such outstanding balances are to be amortized based on the following schedule:</p>\r\n<table>\r\n  <tbody>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <th><em>Years to Maturity</em></th>\r\n      <th><em>Included in Capital</em></th>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td>5 years or more</td>\r\n      <td class="align-center">100%</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td>4 years and less than 5 years</td>\r\n      <td class="align-center">80%</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td>3 years and less than 4 years</td>\r\n      <td class="align-center">60%</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td>2 years and less than 3 years</td>\r\n      <td class="align-center">40%</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td>1 year and less than 2 years</td>\r\n      <td class="align-center">20%</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td>Less than 1 year</td>\r\n      <td class="align-center">0%</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<div class="clear"></div>\r\n<p>For instruments issued prior to January 1, 2015, where the terms of the instrument include a redemption option that is not subject to prior approval of the Superintendent and/or holders\' retraction rights, amortization should begin five years prior to the effective dates governing such options. For example, a 20-year debenture that can be redeemed at the insurer\'s option at any time on or after the first 10 years would be subject to amortization commencing in year 5. Further, where a subordinated debt was redeemable at the insurer`s option at any time without the prior approval of the Superintendent, the instrument would be subject to amortization from the date of issuance. For greater certainty, this would not apply when redemption requires the Superintendent\'s approval as is required for all instruments issued pursuant to the above criteria in section 2.1.3.1.</p>\r\n<p>Amortization should be computed at the end of each fiscal quarter based on the &quot;years to maturity&quot; schedule above. Thus, amortization would begin during the first quarter that ends within five calendar years to maturity. For example, if an instrument matures on October 15, 2020, 20% amortization of the issue would occur on October 16, 2015 and be reflected in the December 31, 2015 regulatory return. An additional 20% amortization would be reflected in each subsequent December 31 return.</p>\r\n<h4><em>2.1.4. Non-controlling interests</em></h4>\r\n<p>P&amp;C insurers are permitted to include, in capital available, non-controlling interests in operating consolidated subsidiaries, provided:</p>\r\n<ol class="list-lower-roman">\r\n  <li>the capital instruments meet the qualifying criteria under category A, B and C; </li>\r\n  <li>the capital in the subsidiary is not excessive in relation to the amount necessary to carry on the subsidiary\'s business; and </li>\r\n  <li>the level of capitalization of the subsidiary is comparable to that of the insurance company as a whole.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>If a subsidiary issues capital instruments for the funding of the P&amp;C insurer, or that are substantially in excess of its own requirements, the terms and conditions of the issue, as well as the intercompany transfer, must ensure that investors are placed in the same position as if the instrument were issued by the P&amp;C insurer directly in order for it to qualify as capital available upon consolidation. This can only be achieved by the subsidiary using the proceeds of the issue to purchase a similar instrument from the parent. Since subsidiaries cannot buy shares of the parent P&amp;C insurance company, it is likely that this treatment will only be applicable to the subordinated debt. In addition, to qualify as capital for the consolidated entity, the debt held by third parties cannot effectively be secured by other assets, such as cash, held by the subsidiary.</p>\r\n<h3 id="Toc-2.2">2.2. Capital Composition Limits</h3>\r\n<p>The inclusion of capital instruments qualifying under category B and category C criteria is subject to the following limits:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>The sum of capital instruments meeting the qualifying criteria under category B and category C will not exceed 40% of total capital available, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income;</li>\r\n  <li>Capital instruments meeting the qualifying criteria under category C will not exceed 7% of total capital available, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Category B and category C capital exceeding the allowable limits will be subject to the following treatment for regulatory capital purposes:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>In cases where capital instruments qualifying under one of either category B or C exceed the limits, the capital in excess of the limits will not be considered in the calculation of capital available. In cases where capital instruments both under category B and category C are in excess of the prescribed limits, the greater value of the two excess amounts will be excluded from capital available. In doing so, P&amp;C insurers must first fully exclude excess capital under category C, followed by excess capital under category B. </li>\r\n  <li>Under certain exceptional circumstances and subject to OSFI\'s supervisory approval, a company may be permitted to continue to include such excess amounts in capital available temporarily, upon providing OSFI with a satisfactory plan outlining the company\'s strategy to achieve compliance with the limits as soon as possible. Typically, only those excesses arising after issuance and as a result of operating losses or extraordinary events beyond the control of management will normally be eligible for temporary inclusion in capital available. In most other circumstances, for example, excesses resulting from:\r\n    <ol>\r\n      <li>purchases or redemptions of capital instruments; </li>\r\n      <li>discretionary dividend payments; </li>\r\n      <li>new issuances of non-common capital instruments within the same fiscal quarter; or </li>\r\n      <li>foreseeable events; <br />\r\n        would generally <strong>not</strong> qualify for inclusion in capital available.</li>\r\n    </ol>\r\n  </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 id="Toc-2.3">2.3.

Definition of registered reinsurer</em></p>\r\n<p>A reinsurer is generally considered to be a registered reinsurer if it is:</p>\r\n<ol class="list-lower-alpha">\r\n  <li>a reinsurer that is either:\r\n    <ol class="list-lower-roman">\r\n      <li>incorporated federally and has reinsured the risks of the ceding company, or</li>\r\n      <li>a foreign company that has reinsured in Canada the risks of the ceding company, <br />\r\n        and is authorized by order of the Superintendent to do so; </li>\r\n    </ol>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>a provincially/territorially regulated insurer that has been approved by the Superintendent;</li>\r\n  <li>the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia;</li>\r\n  <li>the Manitoba Public Insurance Corporation;</li>\r\n  <li>Saskatchewan Government Insurance; and</li>\r\n  <li>Export Development Canada.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Subsection 578(5) of the ICA requires a foreign company, in respect of risks it reinsures in Canada, to set out in all premium notices, applications for policies and policies (which may include cover notes, offer letters or quotations) a statement that the document was issued or made in the course of its insurance business in Canada. In cases where the cover note, offer letter or quotation can be considered neither an application for a policy nor a policy, a P&amp;C insurer will be permitted to treat a reinsurance arrangement as registered reinsurance only if the foreign reinsurer includes, in the cover note, offer letter or quotation, a statement that the foreign reinsurer intends to issue the policy under negotiation in the course of its insurance business in Canada, and that it will take measures to ensure that the cedant\'s risks will be reinsured in Canada in accordance with OSFI\'s advisory No. 2007-01-R1 entitled <a href="/Eng/fi-if/app/rla-prl/Pages/Adv_insurance_riskr1.aspx"><em>Insurance in Canada of Risks</em></a>.</p>\r\n<p>With respect to a Canadian company\'s reinsurance of out-of-Canada business only, reinsurers regulated in an OECD country may be recognized as &quot;registered&quot; on the basis of financial soundness, provided that the reinsurance agreements are recognized by the regulatory agencies of the countries in question. OSFI retains the authority to disqualify such reinsurance if not satisfied with the financial condition of the reinsuring company.</p>\r\n<p>All out-of-Canada business ceded to reinsurers not satisfying the recognized &quot;registered&quot; definition in the previous paragraph must follow the requirements of section 4.3.3 and must be reported in the exhibit<em> Reinsurance Ceded to Unregistered Insurers</em> (the unregistered reinsurance exhibit) of the P&amp;C Returns.</p>\r\n<p><em>4.3.2.2. Risk factors</em></p>\r\n<p>The risk of uncollectability of recoverables from reinsurers arises from the risk that the reinsurer will fail to pay the P&amp;C insurer what it is owed. There is additional risk associated with mis-assessing the amount of the required provision. The risk factor applied to unpaid claims and unearned premiums recoverable from registered non-associated reinsurers is treated as a combined weight under the MCT and is set at 2.5% (reference section <a href="#Toc-6.1">6.1</a>).</p>\r\n<p>The registered reinsurer risk factors are as follows:</p>\r\n<table>\r\n  <tbody>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <th>Balance Sheet Asset</th>\r\n      <th>From Non-Associated<br />\r\n        Registered Reinsurer<br />\r\n        <em>Risk Factor</em></th>\r\n      <th>From Associated<br />\r\n        Registered Reinsurer<br />\r\n        <em>Risk Factor</em></th>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td>Insurance receivables</td>\r\n      <td class="align-center">0.7%</td>\r\n      <td class="align-center">0%</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td>Unearned premiums recoverable</td>\r\n      <td class="align-center">2.5%</td>\r\n      <td class="align-center">0%</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td>Unpaid claims recoverable </td>\r\n      <td class="align-center">2.5%</td>\r\n      <td class="align-center">0%</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<div class="clear"></div>\r\n<h4><em>4.3.3.

In particular, collateral used may not be related party obligations of the unregistered reinsurer (i.e. obligations of the reinsurer itself, its parent, or one of its subsidiaries or associates). With respect to the above three sources available to obtain credit, this implies that:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>To the extent that a ceding P&amp;C insurer is reporting obligations due from a related party of the reinsurer as assets in its annual return, the ceding P&amp;C insurer is precluded from taking credit for funds held to secure payment from the unregistered reinsurer;</li>\r\n  <li>Reinsurers\' assets located in Canada in which a ceding company has a valid and perfected first priority security interest under applicable law may not be used to obtain credit if they are obligations of a related party of the unregistered reinsurer; and</li>\r\n  <li>A letter of credit is not acceptable if it has been issued by a related party of the unregistered reinsurer. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Collateral must be available to the company for a period of not less than the remaining term of the ceded liabilities in order to be valid towards obtaining credit for unregistered reinsurance. In cases where an arrangement contains a renewal provision for the cedant to maintain collateral for a part of or the whole of the remaining term of ceded liabilities (e.g. additional fees or higher interest rate), the renewal provision should be included when determining the ceded reserves.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Non-owned deposits from reinsurers</em></strong><strong> </strong></p>\r\n<p>P&amp;C insurers that have received non-owned deposits provided by an unregistered reinsurer must comply with OSFI\'s <a href="/Eng/fi-if/rai-eri/sp-ps/Pages/rsa.aspx"><em>Guidance for</em> <em>Reinsurance Security Agreements</em></a>.</p>\r\n<p>Deposits from reinsurers that are &quot;not owned&quot; by a P&amp;C insurer, including deposits held on behalf of reinsurers, are not to be reported on the P&amp;C insurer\'s balance sheet.

Financial Resources</em></p>\r\n<p>An insurer must have adequate financial resources to cover its earthquake risk exposure calculated in section 4.5.1.1. Financial resources that can be used to support the insurer\'s earthquake risk exposure include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>capital &amp; surplus; </li>\r\n  <li>earthquake premium reserve; </li>\r\n  <li>reinsurance coverage; and</li>\r\n  <li>capital market financing. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><em>Capital and Surplus</em></p>\r\n<p>Insurers can count up to a maximum of 10% of capital and surplus as part of their financial resources to cover their earthquake risk exposure. This maximum limit is subject to supervisory discretion and can be lowered to an amount less than 10% of capital and surplus.</p>\r\n<p>For Canadian P&amp;C insurers, the amount of capital and surplus corresponds to a maximum of 10% of total equity as at the end of the reporting period being filed.</p>\r\n<p>A Canadian branch of a foreign P&amp;C insurer may use up to 10% of its worldwide capital and surplus to cover its earthquake risk exposure; however, it must be able to demonstrate that after an event, at least 10% of the worldwide capital and surplus is still available to meet its obligations to Canadian policyholders. The amount of worldwide capital and surplus corresponds to the Canadian dollar amount as at the end of the most recent reporting period filed in the home jurisdiction.</p>\r\n<p><em>Earthquake Premium Reserve</em></p>\r\n<p>Earthquake Premium Reserve(EPR)is the voluntary accumulation of earthquake premiums.

Nuclear reserve</em></h4>\r\n<p>P&amp;C insurers issuing nuclear risk policies are required to record an additional provision of 100% of net premiums written, net of commissions, multiplied by 1.25. In the absence of meaningful statistical data on the severity and frequency of losses, OSFI considers it appropriate for P&amp;C insurers to reverse this provision after twenty years.</p>\r\n<h3 id="Toc-4.6">4.6. Accident and Sickness Business</h3>\r\n<p>Accident and sickness reserves determined by actuaries in their valuations are primarily intended to cover expected variations in these requirements based on assumptions about mortality and morbidity. Margins on unearned premiums and unpaid claims for accident and sickness insurance are included in the MCT to take into account possible abnormal negative variations in actual requirements.</p>\r\n<p>The unearned premiums margin is calculated by applying a factor to annual earned premiums. Generally, the factor varies with the length of the premium guarantee remaining. For Canadian P&amp;C insurers, a margin for deferred policy acquisition expenses (DPAE) arising from commissions is also required and is calculated by multiplying DPAE commissions, net of an adjustment for unearned commissions, by 45%. The unpaid claims margin is calculated by applying a factor to the unpaid claims experience relating to prior years. Generally, the factor varies with the length of benefit period remaining.</p>\r\n<p>A worksheet for calculating the margin required for accident and sickness business as well as instructions for completing the worksheet are included in this section. The total requirement calculated on the worksheet should be included in the amount reported as the margin required for unpaid claims and premium liabilities in the MCT.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Instructions for completing the worksheet</strong></p>\r\n<p>Mortality/morbidity risk for accident and sickness insurance is the risk that the liability assumptions about mortality and morbidity rates will be wrong.</p>\r\n<p>To compute the mortality/morbidity component, a factor is applied to the measure of the exposure to the risk. The resulting values are added to arrive at the unearned premiums and unpaid claims margin requirements.</p>\r\n<p>The factors used in deriving the risk component vary with the guaranteed term remaining in the exposure measure. The measure of the exposure to risk is as follows:</p>\r\n<table>\r\n  <tbody>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <th>Risk</th>\r\n      <th>Measure of Exposure</th>\r\n      <th>Applicable Guaranteed Term</th>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td>Disability Income, New Claims Risk</td>\r\n      <td>Annual net earned premiums</td>\r\n      <td>the length of the premium guarantee remaining</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td>Disability Income, Continuing Claims Risk</td>\r\n      <td>Disability income net reserves relating to claims of prior years</td>\r\n      <td>the length of the benefit period remaining</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td>Accidental Death and Dismemberment</td>\r\n      <td>Net amount at risk = the total net face amount of insurance less the policy liabilities (even if negative)</td>\r\n      <td>the period over which the mortality cost cannot be changed (limited to the remaining period to expiry or maturity)</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<div class="clear"></div>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li><strong>Disability income insurance </strong>\r\n    <p>The additional risks associated with non-cancellable guaranteed premium business should be recognized.

Market Risk</h2>\r\n<p>Market risk arises from potential changes in rates or prices in various markets such as for interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equities, real estate, and other market risk exposures. Exposure to this risk results from trading, investing, and other business activities, which create on- and off-balance sheet positions.</p>\r\n<p>Investments in mutual funds or other similar assets must be broken down by type of investment (bonds, preferred shares, common shares, etc.) and assigned the appropriate risk factor relating to the investment. If these investments are not reported on a prorated basis, then the factor of the riskiest asset held in the fund is assigned to the entire investment.</p>\r\n<h3 id="Toc-5.1">5.1. Interest Rate Risk </h3>\r\n<p>Interest rate risk represents the risk of economic loss resulting from market changes in interest rates and the impact on interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities. Interest rate risk arises due to the volatility and uncertainty of future interest rates.</p>\r\n<p>Assets and liabilities whose value depends on interest rates are affected. Interest rate sensitive assets include fixed income assets. Interest rate sensitive liabilities include those for which the values are determined using a discount rate.</p>\r\n<p>To compute the interest rate risk margin, a duration and an interest rate shock factor are applied to the fair value of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities. The interest rate risk margin is the difference between the change in the value of interest rate sensitive assets and the change in the value of interest rate sensitive liabilities, taking into account the change in the value of recognized interest rate derivative contracts, as appropriate.</p>\r\n<h4>5.1.1. General requirements</h4>\r\n<p>The components used to calculate the interest rate risk margin are as follows.</p>\r\n<p><em>5.1.1.1. Interest rate sensitive assets</em></p>\r\n<p>The interest rate sensitive assets to be included in the calculation of the interest rate margin are those for which their fair value will change with movements in interest rates. Although certain assets, for example loans and bonds held to maturity, may be reported on the balance sheet on an amortized cost basis, their economic value, and changes in that value, are to be considered for interest rate risk margin purposes. Interest rate sensitive assets include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>term deposits and other similar short-term securities (excluding cash),</li>\r\n  <li>bonds and debentures,</li>\r\n  <li>commercial paper,</li>\r\n  <li>loans,</li>\r\n  <li>mortgages (residential and commercial),</li>\r\n  <li>mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities (MBS and ABS),</li>\r\n  <li>preferred shares, and</li>\r\n  <li>interest rate derivatives held for other than hedging purposes. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Investments in mutual funds and other similar assets should be broken down by type of investment (bond, preferred share, common shares, etc.). The assets in the fund that are interest rate sensitive are to be included in the determination of the fair value of the P&amp;C insurer\'s total interest rate sensitive assets.</p>\r\n<p>Other assets, such as cash, investment income due and accrued, common shares and investment properties, are not to be included in the determination of the value of interest rate sensitive assets. Such assets are assumed for interest rate risk margin determination purposes to be insensitive to movements in interest rates.</p>\r\n<p>Branches of foreign companies are to include only vested interest rate sensitive assets in the determination of the margin for interest rate risk. Since non-vested assets are not included in net assets available, they do not attract a capital requirement for interest rate risk.</p>\r\n<p><em>5.1.1.2. Interest rate sensitive liabilities</em></p>\r\n<p>The interest rate sensitive liabilities to be included in the calculation of the interest rate risk margin are those for which their fair value will change with movements in interest rates. The following liabilities are considered sensitive to interest rates and are to be included:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>net unpaid claims and adjustment expenses, and</li>\r\n  <li>net premium liabilities.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>P&amp;C insurers must obtain OSFI\'s supervisory approval in order to be able to consider other liabilities in the calculation of interest rate risk margin.</p>\r\n<p>Net unpaid claims and adjustment expenses, which include PfADs, are net of reinsurance, salvage and subrogation, and self-insured retentions. Net premium liabilities, which also include PfADs, are after reinsurance recoverables.</p>\r\n<p><em>5.1.1.3. Allowable interest rate derivatives</em></p>\r\n<p>Interest rate derivatives are those for which the cash flows are dependent on future interest rates. They may be used to hedge a P&amp;C insurer\'s interest rate risk and as such may be recognized in the determination of the margin required for interest rate risk, subject to the conditions below.</p>\r\n<p>Only plain-vanilla interest rate derivatives that clearly serve to offset fair value changes in a company\'s capital position due to changes in interest rates may be included in the interest rate risk calculation. Plain-vanilla interest rate derivative instruments are limited to the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>interest rate and bond futures, </li>\r\n  <li>interest rate and bond forwards, and </li>\r\n  <li>single-currency interest rate swaps. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Other interest rate derivatives, including interest rate options, caps and floors are not considered plain-vanilla and may not be recognized in the determination of the interest rate risk margin.</p>\r\n<p>P&amp;C insurers must understand the interest rate hedging strategies that they have in place and be able to demonstrate to OSFI, upon request, that the underlying hedges decrease interest rate risk exposure and that the addition of such derivatives does not result in overall increased risk. For example, P&amp;C insurers are expected to be able to demonstrate that they have defined the hedging objectives, the class of risk being hedged, the nature of the risk being hedged, the hedge horizon, and have considered other factors, such as the cost and liquidity of the hedging instruments. In addition, the ability to demonstrate an assessment, retrospectively or prospectively, of the performance of the hedge would be appropriate. If the P&amp;C insurer cannot demonstrate that the derivatives result in decreased overall risk, then additional capital may be required, and companies in this situation should contact OSFI for details.</p>\r\n<p>Derivatives used for hedging a P&amp;C insurer\'s interest rate risk are subject to credit risk requirements. Refer to section <a href="#Toc-6.2">6.2</a> for further details.</p>\r\n<p><em>5.1.1.4. Duration of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities</em></p>\r\n<p>P&amp;C insurers are required to calculate the duration of the interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities for the purpose of the interest rate risk requirement calculation. The duration of an asset or a liability is a measure of the sensitivity of the value of the asset or liability to changes in interest rates. More precisely, it is the percentage change in an asset or liability value given a change in interest rates.</p>\r\n<p>The calculation of duration for an asset or liability will depend on the duration measure chosen and whether the cash flows of the asset or liability are themselves dependent on interest rates. <em>Modified duration </em>is a duration measure in which it is assumed that interest rate changes do not change the expected cash flows. <em>Effective duration</em> is a duration measure in which recognition is given to the fact that interest rate changes may change the expected cash flows.</p>\r\n<p>A P&amp;C insurer may use either modified duration or effective duration to calculate the duration of its assets and liabilities. However, the duration methodology chosen should apply to all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities under consideration and the same methodology must be used consistently from year to year (i.e. &quot;cherry-picking&quot; is not permitted).</p>\r\n<p>The cash flows associated with interest rate derivatives are sensitive to changes in interest rates and therefore the duration of an interest rate derivative must be determined using effective duration. In particular, if a company has interest rate derivatives on its balance sheet that lie within the scope of section 5.1.1.3, then it must use effective duration for all of its interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities.</p>\r\n<p>The <em>portfolio duration</em> (modified or effective) can be obtained by calculating the weighted average of the duration of the assets or the liabilities in the portfolio.</p>\r\n<p>The <em>dollar duration</em> of an asset or liability is the change in dollar value of an asset or liability for a given change in interest rates.</p>\r\n<p><em>5.1.1.5. Modified duration</em></p>\r\n<p>Modified duration is defined as the approximate percentage change in the present value of cash flows for a 100 basis point change in the annually compounded yield rate, assuming that expected cash flows do not change when interest rates change.</p>\r\n<p>Modified duration can be written as:</p>\r\n<img title="Modified duration" alt="Modified duration" src="/Eng/PublishingImages/mct2015_form1.png" />\r\n<p>where,</p>\r\n<p style="text-indent:1%">Yield = the annually compounded yield to maturity of the cash flows, <br />\r\n  PVCF<sub>t</sub> = the present value of the cash flow at time t discounted at the yield rate, and</p>\r\n<p>the sum in the numerator is taken over all times t at which a cash flow occurs.</p>\r\n<p><em>5.1.1.6. Effective duration</em></p>\r\n<p>Effective duration is a duration measure in which recognition is given to the fact that interest rate changes may change the expected cash flows. Although modified duration will give the same estimate of the percentage fair value change for an option-free series of cash flows, the more appropriate measure for any series of cash flows with an embedded option is effective duration.</p>\r\n<p>Effective duration is determined as follows:</p>\r\n<img title="Effective duration" alt="Effective duration" src="/Eng/PublishingImages/mct2015_form2.png" />\r\n<p>where,</p>\r\n<dl>\r\n  <dt>\xe2\x88\x86y</dt>\r\n  <dd>\r\n    <p>change in yield in decimal</p>\r\n  </dd>\r\n  <dt>V<sub>0</sub></dt>\r\n  <dd>\r\n    <p>initial fair value</p>\r\n  </dd>\r\n  <dt>V<sub>-</sub></dt>\r\n  <dd>\r\n    <p>fair value if yields decline by \xe2\x88\x86y</p>\r\n  </dd>\r\n  <dt>V<sub>+</sub></dt>\r\n  <dd>\r\n    <p>fair value if yields increase by \xe2\x88\x86y,</p>\r\n  </dd>\r\n</dl>\r\n<p>then effective duration is as follows:</p>\r\n<img title="Effective duration 2" alt="Effective duration 2" src="/Eng/PublishingImages/mct2015_form3.png" />\r\n<p><em>5.1.1.7. Portfolio duration</em></p>\r\n<p>The duration of a portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets or liabilities is to be determined by calculating the weighted average of the duration of the assets or liabilities in the portfolio. The weight is the proportion of the portfolio that a security comprises. Mathematically, a portfolio\'s duration is calculated as follows:</p>\r\n<p style="text-indent:10%"><em>w<sub>1</sub>D<sub>1</sub> + w<sub>2</sub>D<sub>2</sub> + w<sub>3</sub>D<sub>3</sub> + \xe2\x80\xa6 + w<sub>k</sub>D<sub>K</sub></em></p>\r\n<p>where,</p>\r\n<dl>\r\n  <dt><em>w</em><sub>i</sub></dt>\r\n  <dd>\r\n    <p>fair value of security i/fair value of the portfolio</p>\r\n  </dd>\r\n  <dt><em>D</em><sub>i</sub></dt>\r\n  <dd>\r\n    <p>duration of security i</p>\r\n  </dd>\r\n  <dt><em>K</em></dt>\r\n  <dd>\r\n    <p>number of securities in the portfolio.</p>\r\n  </dd>\r\n</dl>\r\n<p><em>5.1.1.8. Dollar fair value change</em></p>\r\n<p>Modified and effective duration are related to percentage fair value changes. The interest rate risk requirements depend on determining the adjustment to the fair value of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities for dollar fair value changes. The dollar fair value change can be measured by multiplying duration by the dollar fair value and the number of basis points (in decimal form). In other words,</p>\r\n<p style="text-indent:5%">Dollar fair value change = duration x dollar fair value x interest rate change (in decimal)</p>\r\n<p><em>5.1.1.9. Duration of allowable interest rate derivatives</em></p>\r\n<p>Effective duration is the appropriate measure that should be used when assets or liabilities have embedded options. For portfolios with eligible plain-vanilla interest rate derivatives, P&amp;C insurers should be using effective dollar duration because the insurer is hedging the dollar interest rate risk exposure.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Example</strong> <strong>5-1</strong>: Effective dollar duration of a swap</p>\r\n<p>Assuming a P&amp;C insurer has a longer duration for its interest rate sensitive assets and a shorter duration for its interest rate sensitive liabilities, the current dollar duration position of the P&amp;C insurer, prior to taking into consideration any interest rate derivatives, is effectively as follows:</p>\r\n<div class="span-6">\r\n  <p style="text-indent:5%">P&amp;C insurer\'s dollar duration = dollar duration of assets \xe2\x80\x93 dollar duration of liabilities &gt; 0</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="clear"></div>\r\n<p>The P&amp;C insurer enters into a single-currency interest rate swap in which it pays fixed-rate and receives floating-rate. The dollar duration of a swap for a fixed-rate payer can be broken down as follows:</p>\r\n<div class="span-5">\r\n  <table>\r\n    <tbody>\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <td style="border:hidden currentcolor">Effective dollar duration of a swap for a fixed-rate payer</td>\r\n        <td class="align-center" style="border:hidden currentcolor">=</td>\r\n        <td style="border:hidden currentcolor">effective dollar duration of a floating-rate bond \xe2\x80\x93 effective dollar duration of a fixed rate bond</td>\r\n      </tr>\r\n    </tbody>\r\n  </table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="clear"></div>\r\n<p>Assuming the dollar duration of the floating-rate bond is near zero, then</p>\r\n<div class="span-5">\r\n  <table>\r\n    <tbody>\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <td style="border:hidden currentcolor">Effective dollar duration of a swap for a fixed-rate payer</td>\r\n        <td class="align-center" style="border:hidden currentcolor">=</td>\r\n        <td style="border:hidden currentcolor">0 \xe2\x80\x93 effective dollar duration of a fixed-rate bond</td>\r\n      </tr>\r\n    </tbody>\r\n  </table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="clear"></div>\r\n<p>The dollar duration of the swap position is negative; therefore, adding the swap position reduces the company\'s dollar duration of assets and moves the P&amp;C insurer\'s overall dollar duration position closer to zero.</p>\r\n<h4><em>5.1.2.

Foreign Exchange Risk</h3>\r\n<p>The foreign exchange risk margin is intended to cover the risk of loss resulting from fluctuations in currency exchange rates and is applied to the entire business activity of the P&amp;C insurer.</p>\r\n<h4><em>5.2.1. General requirements</em></h4>\r\n<p>Two steps are necessary to calculate the foreign exchange risk margin. The first is to measure the exposure in each currency position. The second is to calculate the capital requirement for the portfolio of positions in different currencies.</p>\r\n<p>The foreign exchange risk margin is 10% of the greater of:</p>\r\n<ol class="list-lower-roman">\r\n  <li>the aggregate net long positions in each currency, adjusted by effective allowable foreign exchange rate hedges if any are used, and</li>\r\n  <li>the aggregate net short positions in each currency, adjusted by effective allowable foreign exchange rate hedges if any are used, </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>where effective allowable foreign exchange rate hedges are limited to plain-vanilla foreign currency derivatives such as futures and forward foreign currency contracts and currency swaps.</p>\r\n<p>Investments in mutual funds and other similar assets should be broken down by type of investment (bond, preferred share, common shares, etc.) for calculating foreign exchange risk margin. The assets in the fund that are denominated in a foreign currency are to be included in the calculation to determine the capital requirement for each currency position. In cases where a claim liability is recorded in Canadian dollars but the settlement of the claim will be made in a foreign currency, the liability must be included in the calculation of the foreign exchange risk margin.</p>\r\n<h4><em>5.2.2. Foreign exchange risk margin</em></h4>\r\n<p><strong><em>Step 1: Measuring the exposure in a single currency</em></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>The net open position for each currency is calculated by summing:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>the net spot position, defined as all asset items less all liability items denominated in the currency under consideration, including accrued interest and accrued expenses if they are subject to exchange rate fluctuations;</li>\r\n  <li>the net forward position (i.e. all net amounts under forward foreign exchange transactions, including currency futures and the principal on currency swaps), valued at current spot market exchange rates or discounted using current interest rates and translated at current spot rates;</li>\r\n  <li>guarantees (and similar instruments) that are certain to be called and are likely to be irrecoverable;</li>\r\n  <li>net future income/expenses not yet accrued but already fully hedged (at the discretion of the reporting institution); and</li>\r\n  <li>any other item representing a profit or loss in foreign currencies. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Adjustments:</strong></p>\r\n<p>For P&amp;C insurers with foreign operations, those items that are currently deducted from capital available in calculating the MCT ratio and are denominated in the corresponding currency may be excluded from the calculation of net open currency positions, to a maximum of zero. For example:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Goodwill and other intangibles; </li>\r\n  <li>Interests in non-qualifying subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures; and</li>\r\n  <li>Non-allowable foreign exchange rate hedges that are not considered in capital available. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Carve-out:</strong></p>\r\n<p>A P&amp;C insurer with a net open long position in a given currency may reduce the amount of the net exposure, to a maximum of zero, by the amount of a carve-out, which is equivalent to a short position of up to 25% of the liabilities denominated in the corresponding currency.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Step 2: Calculating the capital requirement for the portfolio</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>The nominal amount (or net present value) of the net open position in each foreign currency calculated in <em>step 1</em> is converted at a spot rate into Canadian dollars. The gross capital requirement is 10% of the overall net open position, calculated as the greater of:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>the sum of the net open long positions; and </li>\r\n  <li>the absolute value of the sum of the net open short positions. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><em>Example:</em></p>\r\n<p>A P&amp;C insurer has $100 of U.S. assets and $50 of U.S. liabilities.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>The net spot position, defined as assets less liabilities, is a long position of $50. </li>\r\n  <li>The carve-out, using 25% of liabilities, is:\r\n    <p>= 25% * 50<br />\r\n      = 12.5</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>Therefore, the foreign exchange risk margin is:\r\n    <p>= 10% * MAX<sup id="fnb31-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb31"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>31</a></sup> ((net spot position - carve-out), 0)<br />\r\n      = 10% * MAX ((50 \xe2\x80\x93 12.5), 0)<br />\r\n      = 10% * 37.5<br />\r\n      = 3.75</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><em>5.2.2.1. Allowable foreign currency hedges</em></p>\r\n<p>Foreign currency derivatives are those for which the cash flows are dependent on future foreign exchange rates. They may be used to hedge an insurer\'s foreign exchange risk and as such, may be recognized in the determination of the capital requirement for foreign exchange risk, subject to the following requirements.</p>\r\n<p>Only effective hedges that offset the changes in fair value of the hedged item may be included in the foreign exchange risk calculation. The company must be able to demonstrate to OSFI the effectiveness of its foreign exchange hedges.</p>\r\n<p>Companies with foreign currency derivatives on their balance sheet must be able to demonstrate that the addition of such derivatives does not result in increased risk. If the insurer cannot demonstrate that the derivatives do not result in increased risk, then OSFI may require additional capital.</p>\r\n<p>Only plain-vanilla foreign currency derivatives may be recognized in the calculation of the foreign exchange capital requirement. Plain-vanilla foreign currency derivative instruments are limited to the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>futures foreign currency contracts,</li>\r\n  <li>forward foreign currency contracts, and </li>\r\n  <li>currency swaps. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Other foreign currency derivatives, including options on foreign currencies, are not considered plain-vanilla and are not to be recognized in the determination of the foreign exchange risk margin.</p>\r\n<p>Derivatives used for hedging a P&amp;C insurer\'s foreign exchange risk are subject to credit risk requirements. Refer to section <a href="#Toc-6.2">6.2</a> for further details.</p>\r\n<p><em>5.2.2.2. Measurement of forward currency positions</em></p>\r\n<p>Forward currency positions should be valued at current spot market exchange rates. It would not be appropriate to use forward exchange rates since they partly reflect current interest rate differentials. Companies that base their normal management accounting on net present values are expected to use the net present values of each position, discounted using current interest rates and translated at current spot rates, for measuring their forward currency positions.</p>\r\n<p><em>5.2.2.3. Accrued and unearned interest income and expenses</em></p>\r\n<p>Accrued interest, accrued income and accrued expenses should be treated as a position if they are subject to exchange rate fluctuations. Unearned but expected future interest, income or expenses may be included, provided the amounts are certain and have been fully hedged by allowable forward foreign exchange contracts. Companies must be consistent in their treatment of unearned interest, income and expenses and must have written policies covering the treatment. The selection of positions that are only beneficial to reducing the overall position will not be permitted for capital purposes.</p>\r\n<p><em>5.2.2.4. Unregistered reinsurance</em></p>\r\n<p>A separate component calculation must be performed for each group of liabilities ceded to an unregistered reinsurer that is backed by a distinct pool of assets, where the defining characteristic of the pool is that any asset in the pool is available to pay any of the corresponding liabilities. Each calculation should take into consideration the ceded liabilities, the assets supporting them, and deposits placed by the reinsurer to cover the capital requirement for the ceded liabilities if the deposits are in a currency different from the currency in which the ceded liabilities are payable to policyholders. If some of the assets supporting the liabilities ceded to an unregistered reinsurer are held by the ceding company (e.g. funds withheld), the company\'s corresponding liability should be treated as an asset in the calculation of the open positions for the ceded business.</p>\r\n<p>Excess deposits placed by an unregistered reinsurer within a pool of supporting assets may be used to reduce the foreign exchange risk requirement for the corresponding ceded business to a minimum of zero. Any requirements not covered by excess deposits must be added to the ceding company\'s own requirement.</p>\r\n<h3 id="Toc-5.3">5.3. Equity Risk</h3>\r\n<p>Equity risk is the risk of economic loss due to fluctuations in the value of common shares and other equity securities.</p>\r\n<h4><strong><em>5.3.1 Common shares and joint ventures</em></strong></h4>\r\n<p>A 30% risk factor applies to investments in common shares and  joint ventures in which a company holds less than or equal to 10% ownership  interest.</p>\r\n<h4><strong><em>5.3.2 Futures, forwards, and swaps</em></strong></h4>\r\n<p>Equity futures, forwards, and swaps attract a 30% risk factor, which is applied to the market value of the underlying equity security or index. Where a swap exchanges a return on an equity security or index for a return on a different equity security or index, a 30% risk factor applies to the market value of both equity securities or indices for which the returns are being exchanged.</p>\r\n<p><em>Example:</em></p>\r\n<p>A P&amp;C insurer has  entered into a one-year swap during which it will pay the 3-month Canadian  Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR) plus fees, and receive the total return on a  notional index of equities that was worth 100 at the time of inception. The  index of equities is currently worth 110. A 30% equity risk charge will apply  to 110 for the long position in the index, but no capital charge will be  required on the short position in the bond because such a position is not  subject to an equity risk charge.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to the capital requirements set out in this section, futures, forwards, and swaps are subject to credit risk requirements. Refer to section <a href="#Toc-6.2">6.2</a> for further details.</p>\r\n<h4><em>5.3.3 Short positions</em></h4>\r\n<p>The capital requirements for short positions in common shares, equity futures, forwards, and swaps that do not wholly or partially offset a long equity position are determined by assuming the instrument is held long and then applying the corresponding risk factor. Common shares, futures, forwards, and swaps eligible for offset recognition and the corresponding capital treatment are described in section 5.3.4.</p>\r\n<h4><em>5.3.4 Recognition of equity hedges</em></h4>\r\n<p>Equity futures, forwards, and swaps, as well as common shares can be used to wholly or partially hedge an equity exposure. P&amp;C insurers may recognize qualifying equity hedges in the calculation of the capital requirements in accordance with section 5.3.4.1 and 5.3.4.2.</p>\r\n<p>P&amp;C insurers must document the equity hedging strategies employed and demonstrate that the hedging strategies decrease the overall risk. The documentation must be available for review, upon request. If the P&amp;C insurer cannot demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Superintendent, that the hedging strategies result in decreased overall risk, then additional capital above that calculated as per sections 5.3.4.1 and 5.3.4.2 may be required, at the discretion of the Superintendent<sup id="fnb32-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb32"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>32</a></sup>.</p>\r\n<p>For hedges to qualify, they must be issued by an entity that:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li> issues obligations which attract a 0% factor under section 6.1.2; or</li>\r\n  <li>is rated A- or better (including clearing houses rated A- or better).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong><em>5.3.4.1. Identical equity securities or indices</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>Long and short positions in exactly the same underlying equity security or index may be considered to be offsetting so that the capital requirements are calculated for the net exposure only.</p>\r\n<p>Only common shares and plain-vanilla equity futures, forwards, and swaps can obtain the capital treatment under this section. Exotic equity derivatives<sup id="fnb33-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb33"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>33</a></sup> do not qualify for this treatment.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>5.3.4.2. Closely linked equity securities or indices</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>A portfolio of common shares and equity futures, forwards, and swaps can be used to partially hedge the equity exposure of another portfolio of similar instruments. When the instruments contained in both portfolios are closely linked, instead of following the capital requirements set out in sections 5.3.1, 5.3.2, and 5.3.3, P&amp;C insurers may calculate the capital requirements for the combined portfolios in the following manner:</p>\r\n<div class="margin-top-medium margin-bottom-medium border-all align-center span-6">\r\n  <p>(1- Correlation Factor) \xc3\x97 1.5 \xc3\x97 MIN (market value of the portfolio of hedging instruments, market value of the portfolio of instruments being hedged)</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>The  capital requirements set out above are capped at 60% of the minimum market  value of both portfolios.</p>\r\n<p>The difference between the market value of the two portfolios is not considered a hedged position and is subject to a 30% risk factor.</p>\r\n<p>The Correlation Factor is derived by using:</p>\r\n<div class="margin-top-medium margin-bottom-medium border-all align-center span-6">\r\n  <p>CF = A*(B/C)</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="clear"></div>\r\n<p>where:</p>\r\n<p>A represents the historical correlation between the returns on the portfolio of instruments being hedged and the returns on the portfolio of hedging instruments</p>\r\n<p>B represents the minimum of [standard deviation of returns on the portfolio of instruments being hedged, standard deviation of returns on the portfolio of hedging instruments]</p>\r\n<p>C represents the maximum of [standard deviation of returns on the portfolio of instruments being hedged, standard deviation of returns on the portfolio of hedging instruments]</p>\r\n<p>The historical correlations and standard deviations must be calculated on a weekly basis, covering the previous 52-week period. The returns on each portfolio of hedging instruments used to calculate the components of the CF must be determined by assuming that the portfolio is held long. The returns on each portfolio must be measured net of additional capital injections, and must include the returns on each component of the portfolio. For example, the returns on both the long and short legs of a total return swap included in a portfolio must be reflected in the calculation of the CF.</p>\r\n<p>The CF for the previous 52 weeks is required to be calculated for each of the past four quarters. The Correlation Factor is the lowest of the four CFs calculated and is used to calculate capital requirements.</p>\r\n<p>In order for the portfolios to obtain the capital treatment set out in this section, the following conditions must be met:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li> The instruments in both portfolios are limited to exchange-traded common shares, and plain-vanilla equity futures, forwards, and swaps where the underlying asset is an exchange-traded common share or an equity index. Portfolios that contain instruments other than those specified in this section will be subject to the capital treatment under sections 5.3.1, 5.3.2, and 5.3.3.</li>\r\n  <li>The CF is determined at the portfolio level. Individual instruments cannot be carved-out of the portfolios and receive the capital treatment as per section 5.3.4.1.</li>\r\n  <li>The portfolios that are part of a hedging strategy must have been established at least two years prior to the reporting date. In addition, the hedging strategy and the active management strategy on which both portfolios are based must not have changed in the past two years prior to the reporting date<sup id="fnb34-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb34"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>34</a></sup>.

Real Estate Risk</h3>\r\n<p>Real estate risk is the risk of economic loss due to changes in the value of a property or in the amount and timing of cash flows from investments in real estate.</p>\r\n<p>The risk factors are as follows:</p>\r\n<table>\r\n  <tbody>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td>Owner-occupied properties </td>\r\n      <td>10%</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td>Real Estate held for investments purposes</td>\r\n      <td>20%</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<div class="clear"></div>\r\n<p>For owner-occupied properties, the risk factor is applied to the value using the cost model, excluding any unrealized fair value gains (losses) arising at the conversion to IFRS, or subsequent unrealized fair value gains (losses) due to revaluation.</p>\r\n<h3 id="Toc-5.5">5.5. Other Market Risk Exposures</h3>\r\n<p>Other market risk exposures include assets that fall in the category &quot;other assets,&quot; for example, equipment, that are exposed to asset value fluctuations that may result in the value realized upon disposal being less than the balance sheet carrying value. A 10% risk factor applies to other assets as part of the total capital requirements for market risk.</p>\r\n<h2 id="Toc-6">Chapter 6. Credit Risk</h2>\r\n<p>Credit risk is<strong> </strong>the risk of loss arising from a counterparty\'s potential inability or unwillingness to fully meet its contractual obligations due to an insurer. Exposure to this risk occurs any time funds are extended, committed, or invested through actual or implied contractual agreements. Components of credit risk include loan loss/principal risk, pre-settlement/replacement risk and settlement risk. Counterparties include issuers, debtors, borrowers, brokers, policyholders, reinsurers and guarantors.</p>\r\n<p>All on- and off-balance sheet exposures are subject to a specific risk factor that either: 1) corresponds to the external credit rating of the counterparty or issuer or 2) represents a prescribed factor determined by OSFI. To determine the capital requirements for balance sheet assets, factors are applied to the balance sheet values or other specified values of these assets. To determine the capital requirements for off-balance sheet exposures, factors are applied to the exposure amounts determined according to the section <a href="#Toc-6.2">6.2</a>. Collateral and other forms of credit risk mitigators may be used to reduce the exposure.No risk factors are applied to assets deducted from capital available (reference section <a href="#Toc-2.3">2.3</a>). The resulting amounts are summed to arrive at the credit risk capital requirements.</p>\r\n<p>In respect of invested assets, P&amp;C insurers must comply with OSFI\'s Guideline B-2 <a href="/Eng/fi-if/rg-ro/gdn-ort/gl-ld/Pages/b2epc.aspx"><em>Investment Concentration Limit for Property and Casualty Insurance Companies</em></a>.</p>\r\n<h3 id="Toc-6.1">6.1. Capital Requirements for Balance Sheet Assets</h3>\r\n<p>For the purpose of calculating the capital requirements for credit risk, balance sheet assets should be valued at their balance sheet carrying amounts, with the following exceptions:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>loans carried at fair value under the fair value option, fair value hedge accounting, or available-for-sale accounting, which should be valued at amortized cost; and</li>\r\n  <li>off-balance sheet exposures should be valued in accordance with section <a href="#Toc-6.2">6.2</a>. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4><em>6.1.1. Use of ratings</em></h4>\r\n<p>Many of the risk factors in this chapter depend on the external credit rating assigned to an asset or an obligor. In order to use a factor that is based on a rating, a P&amp;C insurer must meet all of the conditions specified in this section. For MCT purposes, P&amp;C insurers may recognize credit ratings from the following rating agencies:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>DBRS</li>\r\n  <li>Moody\'s Investors Service </li>\r\n  <li>Standard and Poor\'s (S&amp;P) </li>\r\n  <li>Fitch Rating Services </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>A P&amp;C insurer must choose the rating agencies it intends to rely on and then use their ratings for MCT purposes consistently for each type of asset or obligation. Companies should not select the assessments provided by different rating agencies with the sole intent to reduce their capital requirements (i.e. &quot;cherry picking&quot; is not permitted).</p>\r\n<p>Any rating used to determine a factor must be publicly available, i.e. the rating must be published in an accessible form and included in the rating agency\'s transition matrix. Ratings that are made available only to the parties to a transaction do not satisfy this requirement.</p>\r\n<p>If a P&amp;C insurer is relying on multiple rating agencies and there is only one assessment for a particular asset or obligor, that assessment should be used to determine the capital requirements. If there are two assessments from the rating agencies used by a P&amp;C insurer and these assessments differ, the P&amp;C insurer should apply the risk factor corresponding to the lower of the two ratings. If there are three or more assessments for an asset or obligor from a P&amp;C insurer\'s chosen rating agencies, the P&amp;C insurer should exclude one of the ratings that corresponds to the lowest capital requirement, and then use the rating that corresponds to the lowest capital requirement of those that remain (i.e. the P&amp;C insurer should use the second-highest rating from those available, allowing for multiple occurrences of the highest rating).</p>\r\n<p>Where a P&amp;C insurer holds a particular securities issue that carries one or more issue-specific assessments, the capital requirements for the asset or obligor will be based on these assessments. Where a P&amp;C insurer\'s asset is not an investment in a specifically rated security, the following principles apply:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>In circumstances where the borrower has a specific rating for an issued debt security, but the P&amp;C insurer\'s asset is not an investment in this particular security, a rating of BBB- or better on the rated security may only be applied to the P&amp;C insurer\'s unrated asset if this asset ranks pari passu or senior to the rated security in all respects. If not, the credit rating cannot be used and the P&amp;C insurer\'s asset must be treated as an unrated obligation.</li>\r\n  <li>In circumstances where the borrower has an issuer rating, this assessment typically applies to senior unsecured assets or obligations on that issuer. Consequently, only senior assets or obligations on that issuer will benefit from a BBB- or better issuer assessment; other unassessed assets or obligations on the issuer will be treated as unrated. If either the issuer or one of its issues has a rating of BB+ or lower, this rating should be used to determine the capital requirements for an unrated asset or obligation on the issuer.</li>\r\n  <li>Short-term assessments are deemed to be issue specific. They can only be used to derive capital requirements for assets or obligations arising from the rated facility. They cannot be generalized to other short-term assets or obligations, and in no event can a short-term rating be used to support a risk factor for an unrated long-term asset or obligation.</li>\r\n  <li>Where the risk factor for an unrated exposure is based on the rating of an equivalent exposure to the borrower, foreign currency ratings should be used for exposures in foreign currency. Canadian currency ratings, if separate, should only be used to determine the capital requirements for assets or obligations denominated in Canadian currency. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The following additional conditions apply to the use of ratings:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>External assessments for one entity within a corporate group may not be used to determine the risk factors for other entities within the same group.</li>\r\n  <li>No rating may be inferred for an unrated entity based on assets that the entity possesses.</li>\r\n  <li>In order to avoid the double counting of credit enhancement factors, companies may not recognize credit risk mitigation if the credit enhancement has already been reflected in the issue-specific rating.</li>\r\n  <li>A P&amp;C insurer may not recognize a rating if the rating is at least partly based on unfunded support (e.g. guarantees, credit enhancement or liquidity facilities) provided by the P&amp;C insurer itself or one of its associates.</li>\r\n  <li>Any assessment used must take into account and reflect the entire amount of credit risk exposure a P&amp;C insurer has with regard to all payments owed to it. In particular, if a P&amp;C insurer is owed both principal and interest, the assessment must fully take into account and reflect the credit risk associated with repayment of both principal and interest.</li>\r\n  <li>P&amp;C insurers may not rely on unsolicited ratings in determining the risk factors for an asset, except where the asset is a sovereign exposure and a solicited rating is not available. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4><em>6.1.2. Credit risk factors </em></h4>\r\n<p>Various risk factors are applied to invested assets depending on the external credit rating and the remaining term to maturity as outlined below. However, the risk factors for securitization exposures may in some cases be different from those assigned to similarly rated investments .

Capital Requirements for Off-Balance Sheet Exposures</h3>\r\n<p>The capital required for off-balance sheet exposures such as structured settlements, letters of credit or non-owned deposits, derivatives and other exposures is calculated in a manner similar to on-balance sheet assets in that the credit risk exposure is multiplied by a counterparty risk factor to arrive at the capital required. However, unlike most assets, the face amount of an off-balance sheet exposure does not necessarily reflect the true credit risk exposure. To approximate this exposure, a credit equivalent amount is calculated for each exposure. This amount, net of any collateral or guarantees, is then multiplied by a credit conversion factor. For letters of credit and non-owned deposits, the credit equivalent amount is the face value. The determination of the counterparty credit risk categories and the approach for determining the eligibility of collateral and guarantees is the same as it is for other assets. For letters of credit and non-owned deposits, the counterparty credit risk is found under section 4.3.</p>\r\n<p>The risk to a P&amp;C insurer associated with structured settlements, letters of credit, non-owned deposits, derivatives and other exposures and the amount of capital required to be held against this risk is:</p>\r\n<ol class="list-lower-roman">\r\n  <li>The credit equivalent amount of the instrument at the reporting date;</li>\r\n  <li>Less: the value of eligible collateral securities or guarantees (reference section <a href="#Toc-6.3">6.3</a>);</li>\r\n  <li>Multiplied by: a factor reflecting the nature and maturity of the instrument (credit conversion factor); and</li>\r\n  <li>Multiplied by: a factor reflecting the risk of default of the counterparty to a transaction (counterparty credit risk).</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h4><em>6.2.1. Credit equivalent amount</em></h4>\r\n<p>The credit equivalent amount related to off-balance sheet exposures varies according to the type of instrument.</p>\r\n<p><em>6.2.1.1. Structured settlements</em></p>\r\n<p>The credit equivalent amount for a &quot;Type 1&quot; structured settlement is the current replacement cost of the settlement, which is gross of the coverage provided by Assuris.</p>\r\n<p>&quot;Type 1&quot; structured settlements are not recorded as liabilities on the balance sheet, and have the following characteristics:</p>\r\n<ol class="list-lower-roman">\r\n  <li>An annuity is purchased by a P&amp;C insurer who is named the owner. There is an irrevocable direction from the P&amp;C insurer to the annuity underwriter to make all payments directly to the claimant.</li>\r\n  <li>Since the annuity is non-commutable, non-assignable and non-transferable, the P&amp;C insurer is not entitled to any annuity payments and there are no rights under the contractual arrangement that would provide any current or future benefit to the P&amp;C insurer.</li>\r\n  <li>The P&amp;C insurer is released by the claimant indicating settlement of the claim amount.</li>\r\n  <li>The P&amp;C insurer remains liable to make payments to the claimant in the event and to the extent the annuity underwriter fails to make payments under the terms and conditions of the annuity and the irrevocable direction given.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Under this type of structured settlement arrangement, the P&amp;C insurer is not required to recognize a liability to the claimant, nor is it required to recognize the annuity as a financial asset. However, the P&amp;C insurer is exposed to some credit risk by guaranteeing the obligation of the annuity underwriter to the claimant and, consequently, must set aside additional capital.</p>\r\n<p>P&amp;C insurers should refer to Guideline D-5 <a href="/Eng/fi-if/rg-ro/gdn-ort/gl-ld/Pages/d5_ifrs.aspx"><em>Accounting for Structured Settlements</em></a>.</p>\r\n<p><em>6.2.1.2. Derivatives</em></p>\r\n<p>The credit equivalent amount for derivatives is the positive replacement cost (obtained by &quot;marking to market&quot;) plus an amount for potential future credit exposure (an &quot;add-on&quot; factor).</p>\r\n<p>Derivatives include forwards, futures, swaps, purchased options, and other similar contracts. P&amp;C insurers are not exposed to credit risk for the full face value of these contracts (notional principal amount); only to the potential cost of replacing the cash flow (on contracts showing a positive value) if the counterparty defaults.

Other exposures</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-indent:5%"><strong><em>Commitments</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>A commitment involves an obligation (with or without a material adverse change or similar clause) of the P&amp;C insurer to fund its customer in the normal course of business should the customer seek to draw down the commitment. This includes:</p>\r\n<ol class="list-lower-roman">\r\n  <li>extending credit in the form of loans or participations in loans, lease financing receivables, mortgages or loan substitutes; or</li>\r\n  <li>purchasing loans, securities, or other assets. </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Normally, commitments involve a written contract or agreement and a commitment fee or some other form of consideration.</p>\r\n<p>The maturity of a commitment should be measured from the date when the commitment was accepted by the customer, regardless of whether the commitment is revocable or irrevocable, conditional or unconditional, until the earliest date on which:</p>\r\n<ol class="list-lower-roman">\r\n  <li>the commitment is scheduled to expire, or </li>\r\n  <li>the P&amp;C insurer can, at its option, unconditionally cancel the commitment. </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p style="text-indent:5%"><strong><em>Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>A securities repurchase (repo) is an agreement whereby a transferor agrees to sell securities at a specified price and repurchase the securities on a specified date and at a specified price. Since the transaction is regarded as a financing transaction for accounting purposes, the securities remain on the balance sheet. Given that these securities are temporarily assigned to another party, the factor accorded to the asset should be the higher of the factor of the security and the factor of the counterparty to the transaction (net of any eligible collateral).</p>\r\n<p>A reverse repo agreement is the opposite of a repo agreement, and involves the purchase and subsequent sale of a security. Reverse repos are treated as collateralized loans, reflecting the economic reality of the transaction. The risk is therefore to be measured as an exposure to the counterparty. Where the asset temporarily acquired is a security that attracts a preferential factor, this would be recognized as collateral and the factor would be reduced accordingly.</p>\r\n<p style="text-indent:5%"><strong><em>Guarantees provided in securities lending</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>In securities lending, P&amp;C insurers can act as principal to the transaction by lending their own securities or as agent by lending securities on behalf of clients. When the P&amp;C insurer lends its own securities, the risk factor is the higher of:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>the risk factor related to the instruments lent, or</li>\r\n  <li>the risk factor for an exposure to the borrower of the securities. The exposure to the borrower may be reduced if the P&amp;C insurer holds eligible collateral (reference section <a href="#Toc-6.3">6.3</a>). Where the P&amp;C insurer lends securities through an agent and receives an explicit guarantee of the return of the securities, the P&amp;C insurer may treat the agent as the borrower subject to the conditions in section 6.3.2. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>When the P&amp;C insurer, acting as an agent, lends securities on behalf of a client and guarantees that the securities lent will be returned, or the P&amp;C insurer will reimburse the client for the current market value, the P&amp;C insurer should calculate the capital requirement as if it were the principal to the transaction. The capital requirements are those for an exposure to the borrower of the securities, where the exposure amount may be reduced if the P&amp;C insurer holds eligible collateral (reference section <a href="#Toc-6.3">6.3</a>).</p>\r\n<h4><em>6.2.2.

Capital Treatment of Collateral and Guarantees </h3>\r\n<h4><em>6.3.1. Collateral</em></h4>\r\n<p>A collateralized transaction is one in which:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>a company has a credit exposure or potential credit exposure; and</li>\r\n  <li>the credit exposure or the potential credit exposure is hedged in whole or in part by collateral posted by a counterparty or by a third party on behalf of the counterparty. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Recognition of collateral in reducing the capital requirement is limited to cash or securities rated A- or higher. Any collateral must be held throughout the period for which the exposure exists. Only that portion of an exposure that is covered by eligible collateral will be assigned the risk factor given to the collateral, while the uncovered portion retains the risk factor of the underlying counterparty. Only collateral securities with a lower risk factor than the underlying exposure will lead to reduced capital requirements. All criteria in section <a href="#Toc-6.1">6.1</a> around the use of ratings are applicable to collateral. Where a rating is not available for the collateral asset, exposure, or counterparty where applicable, no reduction in capital required is permitted.</p>\r\n<p>The effects of collateral may not be double counted. Therefore, insurers may not recognize collateral on claims for which an issue-specific rating is used that already reflects that collateral.</p>\r\n<p>Collateral securities used to reduce capital requirements must materially reduce the risk arising from the credit quality of the underlying exposure. In particular, collateral used may not be related party obligations of the issuer of the underlying exposure (i.e. obligations of the underlying counterparty itself, its parent, or one of its subsidiaries or associates).</p>\r\n<h4><em>6.3.2. Guarantees</em></h4>\r\n<p>Investments (principal and interest) or exposures that have been explicitly, directly, irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed by a guarantor whose long-term issuer credit rating is A- and higher, may attract the risk factor allocated to a direct claim on the guarantor where the desired effect is to reduce the risk exposure. Thus only guarantees<sup id="fnb42-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb42"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>42</a></sup> issued by entities with a lower risk factor than the underlying counterparty will lead to reduced capital requirements. To be eligible, guarantees must be legally enforceable.</p>\r\n<p>Where the recovery of losses on a loan, financial lease agreement, security or exposure is partially guaranteed, only the part that is guaranteed is to be weighted according to the risk factor of the guarantor (see examples below). The uncovered portion retains the risk factor of the underlying counterparty.</p>\r\n<p>All criteria in section <a href="#Toc-6.1">6.1</a> around the use of ratings remain applicable to guarantees.

Therefore, no capital recognition is given to credit protection on claims for which an issue-specific rating is used that already reflects that protection.</p>\r\n<p>To be eligible, a guarantee must cover the full term of the exposure , i.e. no recognition will be given to a guarantee if there is a maturity mismatch<sup id="fnb43-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb43"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>43</a></sup>.</p>\r\n<p><em>6.3.2.1.

The guarantor may make one lump sum payment of all monies under such documentation to the insurer, or the guarantor may assume the future payment obligations of the counterparty covered by the guarantee. The insurer must have the right to receive any such payments from the guarantor without first having to take legal action in order to pursue the counterparty for payment.</li>\r\n  <li>The guarantee is an explicitly documented obligation assumed by the guarantor.</li>\r\n  <li>Except as noted in the following sentence, the guarantee covers all types of payments the underlying obligor is expected to make under the documentation governing the transaction, for example notional amount, margin payments etc. Where a guarantee covers payment of principal only, interest and other uncovered payments should be treated as an unsecured amount in accordance with section 6.1.2.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>Example 6-1: </strong>Credit risk exposure.</p>\r\n<p>To record a $100,000 bond rated AAA due in 10 years that has a government guarantee of 90%, the P&amp;C insurer would report a balance sheet value of $90,000 ($100,000 x 90%) in the 0% risk weighted category and a balance value of $10,000 ($100,000 - $90,000) in the AAA category under bonds expiring or redeemable in more than five years.

Premium volume</em></h4>\r\n<p>The following risk factors apply to insurance premiums:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li><em>2.50% for direct written premiums </em></li>\r\n  <li><em>1.75% for assumed premiums written arising from third party reinsurance</em></li>\r\n  <li><em>0.75% for assumed premiums written arising from intra-group pooling arrangements</em></li>\r\n  <li><em>2.50% for ceded premiums written arising from third party reinsurance</em></li>\r\n  <li><em>0.75%</em> <em>for ceded premiums written arising from intra-group pooling arrangements</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The 2.50% risk factor for direct written premiums and the 1.75% risk factor for assumed premiums from third party reinsurance capture an insurer\'s operational risk exposure on new business and renewals.</p>\r\n<p>The 2.50% risk factor for ceded premiums from third party reinsurance captures the operational risk remaining with the ceding insurer. While the insurer cedes a portion of its insurance risk exposure through reinsurance, the operational risk remains with the ceding insurer. Because the capital requirements for insurance liabilities (reference section <a href="#_4.2.__Margins">4.2</a>) are calculated on the net amount of risk (net of reinsurance), the portion of operational risk requirement calculated as 8.50% of capital required does not account for the operational risk on the entire business of the insurer.</p>\r\n<p><em>Intra-group pooling arrangements</em></p>\r\n<p>The 0.75% risk factor for assumed and ceded premiums arising from intra-group pooling arrangements captures the additional operational risks associated with pooling premiums within a group compared to a company that does not enter into transactions moving the premiums from a company to another within a group.</p>\r\n<p>Only premiums assumed and ceded from intra-group pooling arrangements between associated Canadian federally or provincially regulated companies are included in <strong><em>P<sub>aig</sub></em></strong> and<strong> <em>P<sub>cig</sub></em></strong>, and a prior supervisory approval from OSFI is required. If prior approval is not granted, the premiums assumed and ceded in the intra-group pooling arrangement will be considered as premiums arising from a third party reinsurance arrangement and, therefore, will be included in <strong><em>P<sub>a</sub></em><sub> </sub></strong>and<strong> <em>P<sub>c</sub></em><sub> </sub></strong>for capital requirement calculation purposes.</p>\r\n<p>In cases where P&amp;C subsidiaries are consolidated in the financial statements of the P&amp;C parent company, <strong><em>P<sub>w</sub>,</em></strong><em> <strong>P<sub>a</sub>, </strong></em>and<strong>P<sub>c</sub></strong>, at the parent level, must be determined on a consolidated basis, while<strong> <em>P<sub>aig</sub></em></strong> and <strong><em>P<sub>cig </sub></em></strong>must be<strong></strong>equal to the non-consolidated intra-group pooled premiums assumed and ceded by the parent company, respectively.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>For example, assume that two subsidiaries, company Y and company Z cede 100% of their direct written business to Company X (the parent). Company X then cedes 20% of the total of the direct business of each company (including the parent\'s business) to each subsidiary. Assuming that each of the three companies write $100 of direct premiums, the following amounts would apply to calculate the operational risk margin for company X:\r\n    <p><strong><em>P<sub>w</sub></em></strong>: 3 x $100 (direct premiums written by each company) = $300<br />\r\n      <strong><em>P<sub>a</sub></em></strong> and<strong> <em>P<sub>c</sub></em></strong>: $0 (assuming all three companies are not part of third party reinsurance arrangements)<br />\r\n      <strong><em>P<sub>aig</sub></em></strong>: 2 x $100 (premiums assumed by company X as part of the intra-group arrangement) = $200 <br />\r\n      <strong><em>P<sub>cig</sub></em></strong>: 2 x $60 (premiums ceded by company X as part of the intra-group arrangement) = $120</p>\r\n    <p>The capital requirement for operational risk associated with the premiums would be calculated as follows: <br />\r\n      (2,50 % <em>P<sub>w</sub></em> + 1,75 % <em>P<sub>a</sub></em> + 2,50 % <em>P<sub>c</sub></em> + 2,50 % <em>P\xce\x94</em>) + <em>MAX</em> (0,75 %<strong></strong><em>P<sub>aig</sub>,<strong> </strong></em>0,75 %<strong></strong><em>P<sub>cig</sub></em>) = <br />\r\n      (7,50 $ + 0 + 0 + 0) + 1,50 $ = 9,00 $</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4><em>7.2.3. Year-over-year premium growth beyond a threshold</em></h4>\r\n<p>Rapid growth, which is linked to acquisitions, new lines of business or changes to existing products or underwriting criteria, can create additional pressures on people and systems. Companies with premium growth beyond a 20% threshold are subject to additional capital requirements for operational risk.</p>\r\n<p>The premium growth requirement is calculated using gross premiums, i.e. direct premiums written plus assumed premiums written. For the purposes of this section, assumed premiums written arising from intragroup pooling arrangements (i.e.<strong><em> Paig</em></strong>) are excluded from gross premiums. A 2.50% risk factor applies to the total amount of gross premiums written in the past 12 months above the 20% growth threshold compared to the gross premiums written for the same period in the previous year.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>For example, assume that as a result of rapid growth, gross premiums increase by 50% from $100 to $150. The amount above the 20% increase ($30) is subject to an additional risk factor of 2.50%. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In the case of an acquisition, the total gross written premiums for a prior reporting period (before the acquisition) is the sum of the gross premiums written by the two separate entities, i.e. the sum of the acquiring and the acquired companies\' gross written premiums.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>For example, assume that in Year T a company A with gross written premiums of $100 for the 12 months period ending December 31, Year T-1 acquired a company B with gross written premiums of $50 for the same period. The merged company reported a total of $225 in gross written premiums for the 12 months period ending December 31, Year T. The capital requirement for operational risk associated with rapid growth in premiums would be calculated as follows:\r\n    <p style="text-indent:10%">2.50% x [225 \xe2\x80\x93 ((100 + 50) x 1.20)] or 2.50% x $45 = $1.13</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4><em>7.2.4. Cap on operational risk margin</em></h4>\r\n<p>A 30% cap serves to dampen the operational risk margin for companies that have high-volume/low-complexity business with high levels of reinsurance. The 30% cap is calculated in relation to total capital required, before the operational risk margin and diversification credit.</p>\r\n<h2 id="Toc-8">Chapter 8. Diversification Credit</h2>\r\n<p>Because losses arising across some risk categories are not perfectly correlated with each other, a company is not likely to incur the maximum possible loss at a given level of confidence from each type of risk simultaneously. Consequently, an explicit credit for diversification is permitted between the sum of credit and market risk requirements, and the insurance risk requirement so that the total capital required for these risks is lower than the sum of the individual requirements for these risks.</p>\r\n<h3 id="Toc-8.1">8.1. Risk Aggregation and Diversification Credit</h3>\r\n<p>The diversification credit is calculated using the following formula:</p>\r\n<img title="Diversification Credit" alt="Diversification Credit" src="/Eng/PublishingImages/mct2015_form5.png" />\r\n<p>where:</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>A</em></strong> is the asset risk margin, which is the sum of capital required for:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>credit risk, including requirements for balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet exposures, and collateral for unregistered reinsurance and self-insured retentions; </li>\r\n  <li>market risk, including interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, equity risk, real estate risk and other market risk exposures.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong><em>I</em></strong> is the insurance risk margin, which is the sum of capital required for:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>unpaid claims and premium liabilities;</li>\r\n  <li>margin required for unregistered reinsurance exposures; and</li>\r\n  <li>catastrophe risk.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong><em>R</em></strong> is the correlation factor between <em>A</em> and <em>I, </em>equal to 50%.</p>\r\n<div class="wet-boew-footnotes" role="note">\r\n  <section>\r\n    <h2 class="wb-invisible" id="fnb">Footnotes</h2>\r\n    <dl>\r\n      <dt>Footnote 1</dt>\r\n      <dd id="fnb1">\r\n        <p>As  an alternative, a value at risk (VaR) at 99.5% confidence level or expert  judgement was used when it was not practical to use the CTE approach.</p>\r\n        <p class="footnote-return"><a href="#fnb1-ref"><span class="wb-invisible"> Return to footnote </span>1<span class="wb-invisible"> referrer</span></a></p>\r\n      </dd>\r\n      <dt>Footnote 2</dt>\r\n      <dd id="fnb2">\r\n        <p>Where repayment is subject to Superintendent\'s approval.</p>\r\n        <p class="footnote-return"><a href="#fnb2-ref"><span class="wb-invisible"> Return to footnote </span>2<span class="wb-invisible"> referrer</span></a></p>\r\n      </dd>\r\n      <dt>Footnote 3</dt>\r\n      <dd id="fnb3">\r\n        <p>The  criteria also apply to non-joint stock companies, such as mutuals, taking into  account their specific constitution  and legal structure.
