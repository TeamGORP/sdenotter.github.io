bank holding companies and trust and loan companies to maintain adequate capital.  The CAR Guideline is not made pursuant to subsections 485(1) or 949(1) of the BA or to subsection 473(1) of the TLCA.  However, the capital standards set out in CAR Guideline A-1 provide the framework within which the Superintendent assesses whether a bank or a trust or loan company maintains adequate capital pursuant to the acts.  For institutions using the IRB approach to credit risk under CAR Guideline A-1, there will be a capital floor on the minimum risk-based capital requirement during a transition period. The floor is derived by applying an adjustment factor to the net total of the following amounts:</p>\r\n<ol class="list-lower-roman">\r\n<li><p>       8% of total risk weighted assets as calculated under this Guideline, plus</p></li>\r\n<li><p>      all capital deductions as calculated under this Guideline, less</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    the amount of any general allowances that OSFI has accepted for inclusion in Tier 2, up to a limit of 0.875% of risk-weighted assets as calculated under this Guideline.</p></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>For institutions receiving approval to use the IRB approach, an adjustment factor of at least 90% will apply for four fiscal quarters followed by an adjustment factor of at least 80% for the next four quarters.  During 2009, OSFI will determine whether floors will continue.</p>\r\n<div class="span-4 module-table-contents">\r\n<h2>Table of Contents</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href="#ToCPart1%3aCreditRisk"><strong>Part 1:  Credit Risk</strong></a>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href="#ToCChapter1Overview">Chapter 1.

Overview</h3>\r\n<p>Outlined below is an overview of the floor calculation for deposit-taking institutions (DTIs) using the IRB approach to credit risk.  More detailed information on specific components of the calculations is contained in subsequent chapters.</p>\r\n<h4>The Entity</h4>\r\n<p> Capital adequacy requirements will be applied to each DTI on a consolidated basis.  The consolidated entity includes all subsidiaries (entities that are controlled) except insurance subsidiaries or other regulated financial institutions whose leverage is inappropriate for a deposit-taking institution and that, because of their size, would have a material impact on the leverage of the consolidated entity.</p>\r\n<h4>Floor Calculation</h4>\r\n<p> This Guideline specifies the amount of risk-weighted assets (reference chapters 3, 4 and 5) and capital deductions (reference chapter 2) that should be used in the IRB floor calculation.  If OSFI has given a DTI approval to include general allowances in its available Tier 2A capital, then the eligible general allowances may be included in the floor calculation up to a limit of 0.875% of the risk-weighted assets calculated under this Guideline.  Any general allowances that are included in the floor calculation must also be added to the amount of risk-weighted assets used in the floor calculation.</p>\r\n<h4>Risk-weighted Assets </h4>\r\n<h5>On-balance sheet (reference chapter 3)</h5>\r\n<p>To derive the amount of risk-weighted assets, the assets of a DTI and credit equivalent amounts for off-balance sheet items are assigned to one of four broad risk categories:</p>\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody><tr><td>0%</td>\r\n<td>     cash and claims on OECD governments;</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td>20%  </td>\r\n<td>   claims on Canadian deposit-taking institutions, OECD banks and non-domestic OECD public sector entities;</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td>50%  </td>\r\n<td>   residential mortgages; and</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td> 100%   </td>\r\n<td>  all other claims.</td></tr>\r\n</tbody></table>\r\n<p>Classification is according to the nature of the counterparty or, if relevant, of the guarantor or of the collateral.</p>\r\n<p>Amounts included in these categories are multiplied by the risk weight for the category, with the resulting weighted values added together to arrive at total risk-weighted assets.</p>\r\n<p>Assets deducted from capital are risk-weighted at 0%.  Such assets include goodwill, investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries, and back-to-back securities.</p>\r\n<p>Recognition of collateral in reducing the credit risk of claims is limited to cash or securities issued by OECD central governments, OECD central banks, OECD public sector entities (reference section 3.5 for definition of Canadian public sector entities), and specified multilateral development banks.  That portion of a claim that is covered by collateral will be assigned the weight given to the collateral (that is, 0% or 20% - reference chapter 5).</p>\r\n<p>Loans or other exposures unconditionally guaranteed by OECD central governments, OECD public sector entities, OECD incorporated banks or Canadian deposit-taking institutions will attract the weight allocated to a direct claim on the guarantor.  Claims guaranteed by non-OECD- incorporated banks will be assigned a 20% risk weight only where the underlying transaction has a residual maturity not exceeding one year.</p>\r\n<h5>Off-balance sheet assets (reference chapter 4)</h5>\r\n<p>The face amount of an off-balance sheet instrument does not always reflect the amount of the credit risk.  To approximate the potential credit exposure for non-derivative products, the face amount of the instrument must be multiplied by a credit conversion factor to derive a credit equivalent amount.  Broadly, the credit conversion factors are:</p>\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody><tr><td>100%  </td>\r\n<td>   direct credit substitutes;</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td>50%  </td>\r\n<td>    transaction-related contingencies, such as bid bonds, performance bonds, etc.;</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td>20%  </td>\r\n<td>    short-term, self-liquidating trade-related contingencies; and</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td> 0%  </td>\r\n<td>    unused portions of commitments with an original maturity of one year or less, or that are unconditionally cancellable at any time.</td></tr>\r\n</tbody></table>\r\n<p>The resulting credit equivalent amount is then treated as an on-balance sheet instrument and is assigned the weight appropriate to the counterparty or, if relevant, the weight assigned to the guarantor or the collateral security.</p>\r\n<p>Separate credit conversion factors have been developed for forwards, swaps, purchased options and similar derivatives.  The maturity of these contracts is also taken into account in their conversion to the credit equivalent on-balance sheet instrument.  Under specified circumstances DTIs may net off-balance sheet exposures (reference chapter 4).</p>\r\n<h3 id="ToCChapter2CapitalDeductions">Chapter 2.  Capital Deductions</h3>\r\n<p>The following items must be included in the total capital deduction used in the floor calculation:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>    goodwill;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    identified intangible assets in excess of 5% of gross tier 1 capital.  This rule applies to identified intangible assets purchased directly or acquired in conjunction with or arising from the acquisition of a business.

Since the transaction is regarded as a financing for accounting purposes, the securities remain on the balance sheet.  Given that these securities are temporarily assigned to another party, the risk weighting accorded to the asset should be the higher of the risk weight of the security and the risk weight of the counterparty to the transaction (net of any eligible collateral (reference 5.1)).</p>\r\n<p>A reverse repurchase agreement is the opposite of a repurchase agreement, and involves the purchase and subsequent sale of a security.  Reverse repos are treated as collateralised loans, reflecting the economic reality of the transaction.  The risk is therefore to be measured as an exposure to the counterparty.  Where the asset temporarily acquired is a security that attracts a preferential risk weighting, this would be recognized as collateral and the risk weighting would be reduced accordingly.</p>\r\n<h3 id="ToCChapter4OffBalanceSheet">Chapter 4.  Off-Balance Sheet</h3>\r\n<h4 id="41">4.1    Categories of Off-Balance Sheet Instruments (Credit Conversion Factor)</h4>\r\n<p>The definitions in this section apply to off-balance sheet exposures.</p>\r\n<h5>Direct Credit Substitutes (100% conversion factor)</h5>\r\n<p>Direct credit substitutes include guarantees or equivalent instruments backing financial claims. With a direct credit substitute, the risk of loss to the DTI is directly dependent on the creditworthiness of the counterparty.</p>\r\n<p>Examples of direct credit substitutes include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>        guarantees given on behalf of customers to stand behind the financial obligations of the customer and to satisfy these obligations should the customer fail to do so; for example, guarantees of:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>       payment for existing indebtedness for services,</li>\r\n<li>        payment with respect to a purchase agreement,</li>\r\n<li>       lease, loan or mortgage payments,</li>\r\n<li>        payment of uncertified cheques,</li>\r\n<li>       remittance of (sales) tax to the government,</li>\r\n<li>        payment of existing indebtedness for merchandise purchased,</li>\r\n<li>       payment of an unfunded pension liability, and</li>\r\n<li>        reinsurance of financial obligations;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p>        standby letters of credit or other equivalent irrevocable obligations, serving as financial guarantees, such as letters of credit supporting the issue of commercial paper;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>        risk participation in bankers\xe2\x80\x99 acceptances and risk participation in financial letters of credit.  Risk participation constitutes guarantees by the participating DTIs such that, if there is a default by the underlying obligor, they will indemnify the selling DTI for the full principal and interest attributable to them; and</p></li>\r\n<li><p>        securities lending transactions, where the DTI is liable to its customer for any failure to recover the securities lent.</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5>Transaction-related Contingencies (50% conversion factor)</h5>\r\n<p>Transaction-related contingencies relate to the ongoing business activities of a counterparty, where the risk of loss to the reporting institution depends on the likelihood of a future event that is independent of the creditworthiness of the counterparty.  Essentially, transaction-related contingencies are guarantees that support particular performance of non-financial or commercial contracts or undertakings rather than supporting customers\xe2\x80\x99 general financial obligations. Performance-related guarantees specifically exclude items relating to non-performance of financial obligations.</p>\r\n<p>Performance-related and non-financial guarantees include items such as:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>        performance bonds, warranties and indemnities.  Performance standby letters of credit represent obligations backing the performance of non-financial or commercial contracts or undertakings.  These include arrangements backing:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>        subcontractors\xe2\x80\x99 and suppliers\' performance,</li>\r\n<li>        labour and material contracts,</li>\r\n<li>       delivery of merchandise, bids or tender bonds, and</li>\r\n<li>       guarantees of repayment of deposits or prepayments in cases of non-performance;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p>        customs and excise bonds.  The amount recorded for such bonds should be the reporting institution\'s maximum liability.</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5>Trade-related Contingencies (20% conversion factor)</h5>\r\n<p>These include short-term, self-liquidating trade-related items such as commercial and documentary letters of credit issued by the DTI that are, or are to be, collateralized by the underlying shipment.</p>\r\n<p>Letters of credit issued on behalf of a counterparty back-to-back with letters of credit of which the counterparty is a beneficiary (&quot;back-to-back&quot; letters) should be reported as documentary letters of credit.</p>\r\n<p>Letters of credit advised by the DTI for which the institution is acting as reimbursement agent should not be considered as a risk asset.</p>\r\n<h5>Sale and Repurchase Agreements (100% conversion factor)</h5>\r\n<p>A repurchase agreement is a transaction that involves the sale of a security or other asset with the simultaneous commitment by the seller that, after a stated period of time, the seller will repurchase the asset from the original buyer at a pre-determined price.  A reverse repurchase agreement consists of the purchase of a security or other asset with the simultaneous commitment by the buyer that, after a stated period of time, the buyer will resell the asset to the original seller at a pre-determined price.  In any circumstance where these are not reported on- balance sheet, they should be reported as an off-balance sheet exposure with a 100% conversion factor.</p>\r\n<h5>Forward Asset Purchases (100% conversion factor)</h5>\r\n<p>A commitment to purchase a loan, security or other asset at a specified future date, usually on prearranged terms.</p>\r\n<h5>Forward/Forward Deposits (100% conversion factor)</h5>\r\n<p>An agreement between two parties whereby one will pay and the other receive an agreed rate of interest on a deposit to be placed by one party with the other at some pre-determined date in the future.  Such deposits are distinct from future forward rate agreements in that, with forward/forwards, the deposit is actually placed.</p>\r\n<h5>Partly Paid Shares and Securities (100% conversion factor)</h5>\r\n<p>Transactions where only a part of the issue price or notional face value of a security purchased has been subscribed and the issuer may call for the outstanding balance (or a further instalment), either on a date pre-determined at the time of issue or at an unspecified future date.</p>\r\n<h5>Note Issuance/Revolving Underwriting Facilities (50% conversion factor)</h5>\r\n<p>These are arrangements whereby a borrower may issue short-term notes, typically three to six months in maturity, up to a prescribed limit over an extended period of time, commonly by means of repeated offerings to a tender panel.  If at any time the notes are not sold by the tender at an acceptable price, an underwriter (or group of underwriters) undertakes to buy them at a prescribed price.</p>\r\n<h5>Commitments (see 4.5)</h5>\r\n<p>A commitment involves an obligation (with or without a material adverse change or similar clause) of the DTI to fund its customer in the normal course of business should the customer seek to draw down the commitment.  Normally, commitments involve a written contract or agreement and a commitment fee, or some other form of consideration.</p>\r\n<h5>Future/Forward Rate Agreements (see 4.3)</h5>\r\n<p>These are agreements between two parties where at some pre-determined future date a cash settlement will be made for the difference between the contracted rate of interest and the current market rate on a pre-determined notional principal amount for a pre-determined period.</p>\r\n<h5>Interest Rate Swaps (see 4.3)</h5>\r\n<p>In an interest rate swap, two parties contract to exchange interest service payments on the same amount of notional indebtedness.  In most cases, fixed interest rate payments are provided by one party in return for variable rate payments from the other and vice versa.  However, it is possible that variable interest payments may be provided in return for other variable interest rate payments.</p>\r\n<h5>Interest Rate Options and Currency Options (see 4.3)</h5>\r\n<p>An option is an agreement between two parties where the seller of the option for compensation (premium/fee) grants the buyer the future right, but not the obligation, to buy from the seller, or to sell to the seller, either on a specified date or during a specified period, a financial instrument or commodity at a price agreed when the option is arranged.  Other forms of interest rate options include interest rate capping agreements and collar (floor/ceiling) agreements.</p>\r\n<p>Options traded on exchanges may be excluded where they are subject to daily margining requirements.</p>\r\n<h5>Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts (see 4.3)</h5>\r\n<p>A forward foreign exchange contract is an agreement between a DTI and a counterparty in which the DTI agrees to sell to or purchase from the counterparty a fixed amount of foreign currency at a fixed rate of exchange for delivery and settlement on a specified date in the future or within a fixed optional period.</p>\r\n<h5>Cross Currency Swaps (see 4.3)</h5>\r\n<p>A cross currency swap is a transaction in which two parties exchange currencies and the related interest flows for a period of time.  Cross currency swaps are used to swap fixed interest rate indebtedness in different currencies.</p>\r\n<h5>Cross Currency Interest Rate Swaps (see 4.3)</h5>\r\n<p>Cross currency interest rate swaps combine the elements of currency and interest rate swaps.</p>\r\n<h5>Financial and Foreign Currency Futures (see 4.3)</h5>\r\n<p>A future is a standardized contractual obligation to make or take delivery of a specified quantity of a commodity (financial instrument, foreign currency, etc.) on a specified future date at a specified price established in a central regulated marketplace.  These transactions are not to be reported where they are subject to daily margining requirements.</p>\r\n<h5>Precious Metals Contracts and Financial Contracts on Commodities (see 4.3)</h5>\r\n<p>Precious metals contracts and financial contracts on commodities can involve spot, forward, futures and option contracts.  Precious metals are mainly gold, silver and platinum. Commodities are bulk goods such as grains, metals and foods traded on a commodities exchange or on the spot market.  For capital purposes, gold contracts are treated the same as foreign exchange contracts.</p>\r\n<h5>Non-equity Warrants (see 4.3)</h5>\r\n<p>Non-equity warrants include cash settlement options/contracts whose values are determined by the movements in a given underlying index, product or foreign exchange over time.  Where non- equity warrants or the hedge for such warrants expose the financial institution to counterparty credit risk, the credit equivalent amount should be determined using the current exposure method for exchange rate contracts.</p>\r\n<h4 id="ToC42CreditConversionFactors">4.2    Credit Conversion Factors</h4>\r\n<p>The face amount (notional principal amount) of off-balance sheet instruments does not always reflect the amount of credit risk in the instrument.  To approximate the potential credit exposure of non-derivative instruments, the notional amount is multiplied by the appropriate credit conversion factor to derive a <strong>credit equivalent amount</strong>.  The process for determining the credit equivalent amounts of derivative instruments is covered in section 4.3.  The resulting credit equivalent amount is then treated in a manner similar to an on-balance sheet instrument and is assigned the risk weight appropriate to the counterparty or, if relevant, the guarantor or collateral. The categories of credit conversion factors are outlined below.</p>\r\n<h5>Credit Conversion Factors </h5>\r\n<h6>100% Conversion Factor</h6>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>        Direct credit substitutes (general guarantees of indebtedness and guarantee-type instruments, including standby letters of credit serving as financial guarantees for, or supporting, loans and securities).</p></li>\r\n<li><p>        Acquisitions of risk participation in bankers\' acceptances and participation in direct credit substitutes (for example, standby letters of credit).</p></li>\r\n<li><p>        Sale and repurchase agreements.</p></li>\r\n<li><p>        Forward agreements (contractual obligations) to purchase assets, including financing facilities with certain drawdown.</p></li>\r\n<li><p>        Written put options on specified assets with the characteristics of a credit enhancement.<sup id="fnb5-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb5"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>5</a></sup> </p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h6>50% Conversion Factor</h6>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>        Transaction-related contingencies (for example, bid bonds, performance bonds, warranties, and standby letters of credit related to a particular transaction).</p></li>\r\n<li><p>        Commitments with an original maturity exceeding one year, including underwriting commitments and commercial credit lines.</p></li>\r\n<li><p>        Revolving underwriting facilities (RUFs), note issuance facilities (NIFs) and other similar arrangements.</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h6>20% Conversion Factor</h6>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>        Short-term, self-liquidating trade-related contingencies, including commercial/ documentary letters of credit.</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h6>0% Conversion Factor</h6>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>        Commitments with an original maturity of one year or less or that are unconditionally cancellable at any time without prior notice.</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4 id="43">4.3    Forwards, Swaps, Purchased Options and Other Similar Derivative Contracts</h4>\r\n<p>The treatment of forwards, swaps, purchased options and other similar derivatives needs special attention because DTIs are not exposed to credit risk for the full face value of their contracts (notional principal amount), but only to the potential cost of replacing the cash flow (on contracts showing a positive value) if the counterparty defaults.  The credit equivalent amounts are calculated using the current exposure method and are assigned the risk weight appropriate to the counterparty.  However, in recognition of the quality of market participants, a 50% weight is applied in respect of counterparties that would otherwise attract a 100% weight.</p>\r\n<p>The add-on applied in calculating the credit equivalent amount depends on the maturity of the contract and on the volatility of the rates and prices underlying that type of instrument. Instruments traded on exchanges may be excluded where they are subject to daily receipt and payment of cash variation margin.

Novation refers to a written bilateral contract between two counterparties under which any obligation to each other to deliver a given currency on a given date is automatically amalgamated with all other obligations for the same currency and value date, legally substituting one single amount for the previous gross obligations.</p>\r\n<p>DTIs that wish to net transactions under either novation or another form of bilateral netting will need to satisfy OSFI<sup id="fnb8-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb8"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>8</a></sup> that the following conditions are met.</p>\r\n<ol class="list-lower-roman">\r\n<li><p>  The DTI must have a netting contract or agreement with each counterparty that creates a single legal obligation, covering all included transactions subject to netting.  The result of such an arrangement would be that the DTI only has one obligation for payment or one claim to receive funds based on the net sum of the positive and negative mark-to-market values of all of the transactions with that counterparty in the event of default, bankruptcy, liquidation or similar circumstances.</p></li>\r\n<li><p>  The DTI must have written and reasoned legal opinions that, in the event of any legal challenge, the relevant courts and authorities would find the exposure to be the net amount under:  a) the law of the jurisdictions where the counterparties are chartered and the laws of any jurisdiction applicable to branches involved; b) the law governing the individual transactions; and c) the law governing any contracts or agreements required to effect netting.</p></li>\r\n<li><p>  The DTI must have procedures in place to ensure that a regular review of the legal characteristics of the netting arrangements for possible changes in law is undertaken to maintain the validity of such contracts.</p></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Any contract containing a walkaway clause will not be eligible to qualify for netting for the purpose of calculating capital requirements.  A walkaway clause is a provision within the contract that permits a non-defaulting counterparty to make only limited payments, or no payments, to the defaulter.</p>\r\n<p>Credit exposure on bilaterally netted forwards, swaps, purchased options and other similar derivatives transactions is calculated as the sum of the net mark-to-market replacement cost, if positive, plus an add-on for potential future credit exposure based on the notional principal of the individual underlying contracts.  However, for purposes of calculating potential future credit exposure of contracts subject to legally enforceable netting agreements in which notional principal is equivalent to cash flows, notional principal is defined as the net receipts falling due on each value date in each currency.  The reason that these contracts are treated as a single contract is that offsetting contracts in the same currency maturing on the same date will have lower potential future exposure as well as lower current exposure.  For multilateral netting schemes, current exposure (i.e., replacement cost) is a function of the loss allocation rules of the clearing-house.</p>\r\n<p>The calculation of the gross add-ons should be based on the legal cash flow obligations in all currencies.  This is calculated by netting all receivable and payable amounts in the same currency for each value date.  The netted cash flow obligations are converted to the reporting currency using the current forward rates for each value date.  Once converted, the amounts receivable for the value date are added together and the gross add-on is calculated by multiplying the receivable amount by the appropriate add-on factor.</p>\r\n<p>The potential future credit exposure for netted transactions (A<sub>Net</sub>) equals the sum of:  (i) 40% of the add-on as presently calculated (A<sub>Gross</sub>)<sup id="fnb9-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb9"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>9</a></sup>; and (ii) 60% of the add-on multiplied by the ratio of net current replacement cost to positive current replacement cost (NPR)<sup id="fnb10-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb10"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>10</a></sup>.</p>\r\n<p>Where </p>\r\n<p>NPR =   level of net replacement cost/level of positive replacement cost for transactions subject to legally enforceable netting agreements.</p>\r\n<p>The calculation of NPR can be made on a counterparty-by-counterparty basis or on an aggregate basis for all transactions, subject to legally enforceable netting agreements.  On a counterparty- by-counterparty basis a unique NPR is calculated for each counterparty.  On an aggregate basis, one NPR is calculated and applied to all counterparties.</p>\r\n<h5>Steps for Determining the Credit Equivalent Amount of Netted Contracts</h5>\r\n<h6>Step 1.

If this is the case, allocate the net replacement cost to the types of derivative instrument by pro-rating the net replacement cost among those instrument types which have a gross positive replacement cost.</p>\r\n<h4 id="ToC45Commitments">4.5    Commitments</h4>\r\n<p>Commitments are arrangements that obligate a DTI, at a client\'s request, to:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>        extend credit in the form of loans or participations in loans, lease financing receivables, mortgages, overdrafts, acceptances, letters of credit, guarantees or loan substitutes; or</p></li>\r\n<li><p>        purchase loans, securities, or other assets.</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Normally, commitments involve a written contract or agreement and some form of consideration, such as a commitment fee.</p>\r\n<h5>Credit Conversion Factors</h5>\r\n<p> The credit conversion factor applied to a commitment is dependent on its maturity.  Longer maturity commitments are considered to be of higher risk because there is a longer period between credit reviews and less opportunity to withdraw the commitment if the credit quality of the drawer deteriorates.</p>\r\n<p>The conversion factors to be applied to commitments can generally be categorized as 0% or 50%, as outlined below.</p>\r\n<h5>0% Conversion Factor</h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>        Commitments with an original maturity of one year and under; and</p></li>\r\n<li><p>        Commitments with an original maturity of over one year where:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>        the DTI has full discretion to withdraw the commitment at any time without notice; and</p></li>\r\n<li><p>        the DTI conducts a formal review of the facility at least annually, thus giving it an opportunity to take note of any perceived deterioration in credit quality.</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5>50% Conversion Factor</h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>        Commitments with an original maturity of over one year;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>        NIFs and RUFs;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>        the undrawn portion of a commitment to provide a loan that will be drawn down in a number of tranches, some less than and some over one year; and</p></li>\r\n<li><p>        forward commitments (where the DTI makes a commitment to issue a commitment) if the loan can be drawn down more than one year after the DTI\xe2\x80\x99s initial undertaking is signed.</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5>Maturity</h5>\r\n<p>DTIs should use original maturity (as defined below) to report these instruments.</p>\r\n<h6>Original Maturity</h6>\r\n<p> The maturity of a commitment should be measured from the date when the commitment was accepted by the customer, regardless of whether the commitment is revocable or irrevocable, conditional or unconditional, until the earliest date on which:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>           the commitment is scheduled to expire, or</p></li>\r\n<li><p>           the DTI can, at its option, unconditionally cancel the commitment.</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>A material adverse change clause is not considered to give sufficient protection for a commitment to be considered unconditionally cancellable.</p>\r\n<p>Where the DTI commits to granting a facility at a future date (a forward commitment), the original maturity of the commitment is to be measured from the date the commitment is accepted until the final date that drawdowns are permitted.</p>\r\n<h6>Renegotiations of a Commitment</h6>\r\n<p> If both parties agree, a commitment may be renegotiated before its term expires.  If the renegotiation process involves a credit assessment of the customer consistent with the DTI\xe2\x80\x99s credit standards, and provides the DTI with the total discretion to renew or extend the commitment and to change any other terms and conditions of the commitment, then on the date of acceptance by the customer of the revised terms and conditions, the original commitment may be deemed to have matured and a new commitment begun.  If new terms are not reached, the original commitment will remain in force until its original maturity date.</p>\r\n<p>This process must be clearly documented.</p>\r\n<p>In syndicated and participated transactions, a participating DTI must be able to exercise its renegotiation rights independent of the other syndicate members.</p>\r\n<p>Where these conditions are not met, the original start date of the commitment must be used to determine maturity.</p>\r\n<h5>Specific Types of Commitments </h5>\r\n<h6>Undated/Open-ended Commitments</h6>\r\n<p> A 0% credit conversion factor is applied to undated or open-ended commitments, such as unused credit card lines, personal lines of credit, and overdraft protection for personal chequing accounts that are unconditionally cancellable at any time.</p>\r\n<h6>Evergreen Commitments </h6>\r\n<p>Open-ended commitments that are cancellable by the financial institution at any time subject to a notice period do not constitute unconditionally cancellable commitments and are converted at 50%.  Long-term commitments must be cancellable without notice to be eligible for the 0% conversion factor.</p>\r\n<h6>Commitments Drawn Down in a Number of Tranches</h6>\r\n<p> A 50% credit conversion factor is applied to a commitment to provide a loan (or purchase an asset) to be drawn down in a number of tranches, some one year and under and some over one year.  In these cases, the ability to renegotiate the terms of later tranches should be regarded as immaterial.  Often these commitments are provided for development projects from which the DTI may find it difficult to withdraw without jeopardizing its investment.</p>\r\n<p>Where the facility involves unrelated tranches, and where conversions are permitted between the over- and under-one year tranches (i.e., where the borrower may make ongoing selections as to how much of the commitment is under one year and how much is over), then the entire commitment should be converted at 50%.</p>\r\n<p>Where the facility involves unrelated tranches with no conversion between the over- and under- one year tranches, then each tranche may be converted separately, depending on its maturity.</p>\r\n<h6>Commitments for Fluctuating Amounts</h6>\r\n<p> For commitments that vary in amount over the life of the commitment, such as the financing of a business subject to seasonal variation in cash flow, the conversion factor should apply to the maximum unutilized amount that can be drawn under the remaining period of the facility.</p>\r\n<h6>Commitment to Provide a Loan with a Maturity of Over One Year</h6>\r\n<p> A commitment to provide a loan that has a maturity of over one year but that must be drawn down within a period of less than one year may be treated as an under-one-year instrument, as long as any undrawn portion of the facility is automatically cancelled at the end of the drawdown period.</p>\r\n<p>However, if through any combination of options or drawdowns, repayments and redrawdowns, etc., the client can access a line of credit past one year, with no opportunity for the DTI to unconditionally cancel the commitment within one year, the commitment shall be converted at 50%.</p>\r\n<h6>Commitments for Off-balance Sheet Transactions </h6>\r\n<p>An over-one-year commitment to provide an off-balance sheet facility (such as a standby letter of credit) should normally use the credit conversion factor of the applicable off-balance sheet instrument.</p>\r\n<h3 id="ToCChapter5GeneralGuidance">Chapter 5.  General Guidance</h3>\r\n<h4 id="ToC51Collateral">5.1    Collateral</h4>\r\n<p>Claims on a counterparty collateralized by cash or by securities issued by OECD central governments, OECD central banks, OECD public sector entities or multilateral development banks, may be assigned the risk weight of the collateral, as follows:</p>\r\n<h5>0% </h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>        cash<sup id="fnb11-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb11"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>11</a></sup>;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>        securities issued by OECD central governments, OECD central banks; Canadian provincial and territorial governments, and agents of the federal, provincial and territorial governments in Canada whose debts are, by virtue of their enabling legislation, direct obligations of the parent-government;</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5>20%</h5>\r\n<ul><li><p>        securities issued by Canadian municipalities and PSEs directly and wholly-owned by a government in accordance with section 3.5, and non-domestic OECD public sector entities; and</p></li>\r\n<li><p>        multilateral development banks\' securities.</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>No other forms of collateral, including DTI securities, may reduce a risk weighting.  If the value of the collateral covers less than the book value of the asset, only the part of the asset that is fully covered may receive the appropriate lower weight.  Generally, for off-balance sheet instruments, collateral should be applied to the notional principal amount.  However, in the case of forwards, swaps, purchased options and similar derivative contracts that are marked-to-market, the collateral is applied against the replacement cost (where positive) plus add-ons.</p>\r\n<p>Cash collateral is restricted to currency deposits or deposit certificates issued by and deposited with the lending institution.  For these purposes, an exposure is collateralized by cash only if the cash is held by the reporting institution for the account of the depositor/customer on express terms such that:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>         the cash may not be withdrawn for the duration or remaining duration of the exposure; and</p></li>\r\n<li><p>         the reporting institution may apply the cash to discharge the exposure if and to the extent that it is not discharged by the borrower/customer in accordance with the terms of the loan, etc., agreement with the borrower/customer and there are no legal impediments to prevent the collateral from being used to discharge the exposure.</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The collateral must be marked-to-market regularly and should be held throughout the period for which the claim was outstanding.</p>\r\n<p>For syndicated loans, where an agent institution holds the cash collateral on behalf of the syndicate, the collateral must be notionally allocated to parallel the syndication of the loan. However, only the agent institution may reduce the risk weight of its collateralized portion of the loan to the risk weight of the collateral.  Provided that there is an explicit agreement that the agent institution is holding the collateral on behalf of the lending syndicate and that the participating institutions have a charge over their share of the collateral, the agent bank will be considered the counterparty for the collateralized portions of loan held by the other participating institutions and they may reduce the risk weight on that portion of the loan accordingly.</p>\r\n<p>To illustrate, assume a $100 loan is syndicated with five institutions each holding $20.  The agent bank - an OECD bank - holds cash collateral of $50, representing $10 for each of the $20 portions of the loan.  The agent may risk weight $10 of its $20 portion at 0%.  The other financial institutions may each risk weight $10 of their $20 portion at 20% (the risk weighting accorded the agent bank - the counterparty).</p>\r\n<h4 id="ToC52Guarantees">5.2    Guarantees</h4>\r\n<p>Claims that have been explicitly, irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed by OECD central governments, OECD public-sector entities, OECD incorporated banks, Canadian deposit-taking institutions, banks incorporated outside the OECD where the claim has a residual maturity of one year or less, multilateral development banks, or securities firms incorporated in the OECD subject to comparable supervisory and regulatory arrangements, may be weighted according to the risk weight of the guarantor where the effect is to reduce the risk. Such guarantees should cover the full term of the instrument and be legally enforceable.  A standby letter of credit serving as a financial guarantee that meets these conditions (i.e., it is explicit, irrevocable and unconditional) can be used in lieu of a guarantee.  Where a claim is partially guaranteed, only that part of the claim that is fully guaranteed will be weighted according to the risk weight of the guarantor.  Claims guaranteed by non-OECD governments or central banks may also be recognized where the claim is denominated and funded in local currencies.</p>\r\n<p>A guarantee by a parent or an unconsolidated affiliate that qualifies for a 20% risk weight of a claim on a third party will not reduce the risk weighting of the assets of the subsidiary DTI in Canada.  This treatment follows the principle that parent company guarantees are not a substitute for capital.  An exception is made for self-liquidating trade-related transactions that have a tenure of 360 days or less, are market-driven and are not structured to avoid guidelines.  These would be eligible for a 20% counterparty risk weight if the entity providing the guarantee qualifies for this reduced risk weight.  The requirement that the transaction be &quot;market-driven&quot; necessitates that the guarantee or letter of credit is requested and paid for by the customer and/or that the market requires the guarantee in the normal course.</p>\r\n<h4 id="ToC53AcceptanceswithRiskParticipation">5.3    Acceptances with Risk Participation</h4>\r\n<p>Federally regulated deposit-taking institutions in Canada are required to report on their balance sheets the full amount of acceptances issued, regardless of whether portions have been participated, and risk weight the full amount for capital adequacy purposes.  However, the counterparty of the participated portions for risk weighting purposes is deemed to be the participating institutions.</p>\r\n<p>The participated portion of the acceptance should not appear on the balance sheet of the participating DTI.  It should be reported with other guarantees in the notes to the financial statements.  A 100% credit conversion factor is applied to these off-balance sheet items and the customer in whose name the acceptance is issued is considered the counterparty to the transaction for risk weighting purposes.</p>\r\n<p>For example, assume a $100 acceptance for a commercial enterprise has been participated to four other OECD banks in equal portions.  The lead DTI would risk weight its portion of the acceptance ($20) at 100%.  The remaining $80 would be risk-weighted at 20%.  The participating DTI would apply a 100% credit conversion factor to their respective $20 portions and risk weight this amount at 100%.</p>\r\n<h2 id="ToCPartII:MarketRisk">Part II: Market Risk</h2>\r\n<h3 id="ToCChapter6Overview">Chapter 6.  Overview</h3>\r\n<h4 id="ToC61OverviewoftheFramework">6.1    Overview of the Framework</h4>\r\n<p>This section provides an overview of the capital adequacy requirements for market risk for Canadian deposit-taking institutions.  More detailed information on specific components of the calculations is contained in subsequent chapters.</p>\r\n<p>These requirements apply only to those institutions where the greater of the value of trading book assets or the value of trading book liabilities:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>          is at least 10% of total assets; and</p></li>\r\n<li><p>          exceeds $1 billion,</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>although OSFI will retain the right to apply the framework to other institutions, on a case by case basis, if trading activities are a large proportion of overall operations.</p>\r\n<h5>Risk Framework - Definitions </h5>\r\n<p>The risk-based capital framework addresses credit risk and market risk.  Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss.  Credit risk is seen as the most significant risk for the non-trading book activities of an institution.  The capital requirements that address credit risk are set out in Part I of this Guideline and apply to non-trading on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet assets such as guarantees, letters of credit, commitments and derivative instruments.</p>\r\n<p>Market risk is the risk of losses in on- and off-balance sheet positions arising from movements in market prices.  The risks pertaining to this requirement are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>    for instruments in the trading book:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>          interest rate position risk; and</p></li>\r\n<li><p>          equity position risk.</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p>    throughout the institution:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>          foreign exchange risk<sup id="fnb12-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb12"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>12</a></sup>; and</p></li>\r\n<li><p>          commodities risk.</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5>Measurement Approaches</h5>\r\n<p> In measuring their market risks, institutions may choose between two broad methodologies: the standardized approach or internal models.</p>\r\n<h6>Standardized Approach</h6>\r\n<p> The standardized methodology uses a &quot;building-block&quot; approach.  The capital charge for each risk category is determined separately.  Within the interest rate and equity position risk categories,  separate capital charges for specific risk and the general market risk arising from debt and equity positions are calculated.  Specific risk is defined as the risk of loss caused by an adverse price movement of a debt instrument or security due principally to factors related to the issuer.  General market risk is defined as the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices.  For commodities and foreign exchange, there is only a general market risk capital requirement.  A summary of the capital charges by instrument is in Appendix 6-I.</p>\r\n<p>The standardized approach is described in chapter 7. The first four sections deal with interest rate, equity position, foreign exchange and commodities risk.  A fifth section sets out two possible methods for measuring the market risk in options of all kinds.</p>\r\n<h6>Internal Models</h6>\r\n<p> The focus of most internal models is an institution\'s general market risk exposure, leaving specific risk to be measured through separate credit risk measurement systems.  Institutions using models are subject to capital charges for the specific risk not captured by their models.  For institutions using models that include specific risk, the total specific risk charge applied to debt securities or to equities should in no case be less than half the specific risk charges calculated according to the standardized methodology.</p>\r\n<p>For institutions using their own internal risk management models to calculate the capital charge(s) there are seven sets of conditions that they must meet.  These are described in detail in chapter 8.  These conditions are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>    certain general criteria concerning the adequacy of the risk management system;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    qualitative standards for internal oversight of the use of models, notably by management;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    guidelines for specifying an appropriate set of market risk factors (i.e., the market rates and prices that affect the value of institutions\' positions);</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    quantitative standards setting out the use of common minimum statistical parameters for measuring risk;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    guidelines for stress testing and back testing;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    validation procedures for external oversight of the use of models; and</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    rules for institutions which use a mixture of models and the standardized approach.</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p> Institutions with significant trading activities are encouraged to move towards a models approach. The need for the standardized approach will be reviewed in future when the industry\'s internal measurement systems are more refined.</p>\r\n<h5>Application </h5>\r\n<p>On-balance sheet assets held in the trading book are subject only to the market risk capital requirements.  Derivative instruments held in the trading book are subject to both the market risk and the credit risk capital requirements.  This is because they face the risk of loss due to:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>    market fluctuations in the value of the underlying instrument;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    failure of the counterparty to the derivative contract.</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Similarly, on-balance sheet assets held outside the trading book and funded by another currency and unhedged for foreign exchange exposure are subject to both the market risk (i.e., foreign exchange) and credit risk capital requirements.</p>\r\n<h5>Trading Book</h5>\r\n<p> Each institution should have a policy providing a definition of what items should be allocated to the  trading book.  For example, it may include on- and off-balance sheet positions in financial instruments acquired with the intent to resell in order to profit from short-term price or rate movements (or other price or rate variations).  All trading book positions must be marked to market daily and the results reflected in an institution\'s earnings statement.</p>\r\n<p>For market risk capital purposes, an institution may include in its measure for general market risk certain non-trading book instruments that it deliberately uses to hedge trading positions. Such instruments are not subject to a specific risk capital charge, but instead, remain subject to the credit risk capital requirements.  On the other hand, an institution should exclude instruments used to hedge non-trading book positions.</p>\r\n<p>An institution may not include or exclude items in the trading book to manipulate associated capital charges.  The institution\'s policy should include the separation of responsibilities for trading and investment portfolios and set out the approval process for moving an item from one book to another.  Where this occurs there should be a clear trail documenting management\'s change of intent that will be reviewed, at a minimum, by internal audit and external audit.  OSFI will monitor the way in which institutions allocate financial instruments to the trading book and non-trading book and will seek to ensure consistent implementation through the examination process.</p>\r\n<h5>The Entity</h5>\r\n<p> In the same way as for credit risk, the capital requirements for market risk are to apply on a consolidated basis.  OSFI will permit financial entities in a group which is running a global consolidated book and whose capital is being assessed on a global basis to report short and long positions in exactly the same instrument (e.g., currencies, commodities, equities or bonds), on a net basis, no matter where they are booked.  Nonetheless, there may be circumstances in which individual positions should be taken into the measurement system without any offsetting against positions in the remainder of the group.  This may be needed, for example, where there are obstacles to the quick repatriation of profits from a foreign subsidiary or where there are legal and procedural difficulties in carrying out the timely management of risks on a consolidated basis.  Institutions should document the rationale and procedures for determining when positions should be netted and not netted.  These should be available for OSFI review.  Moreover, OSFI will retain the right to monitor the market risks of individual entities on a non-consolidated basis to ensure that significant imbalances within a group do not escape supervision.</p>\r\n<h4 id="ToC62CapitalRequirement">6.2    Capital Requirement</h4>\r\n<p>Each institution will be expected to monitor and report the level of risk against which a capital requirement is to be applied.

Standardized Approach</h3>\r\n<h4 id="ToC71InterestRatePositionRisk">7.1    Interest Rate Position Risk</h4>\r\n<p>This section describes the way in which an institution will calculate its capital requirement for interest rate positions held in the trading book where that institution does not use an internal model that meets the criteria set out in chapter 8.  The interest rate exposure captured includes exposures arising from interest-bearing and discounted financial instruments, derivatives based on the movement of interest rates and interest rate exposures embedded in derivatives based on non-interest related derivatives including foreign exchange forward contracts.  The market risk capital charge for interest rate options in an institution\'s trading book is calculated separately.</p>\r\n<p>Convertible bonds, i.e., debt instruments or preference shares that are convertible, at a stated price, into common shares of the issuer, will be treated as debt securities if they trade like debt securities and as equities if they trade like equities.  Convertible bonds must be treated as equities where:</p>\r\n<ol class="list-lower-alpha">\r\n<li><p> the first date at which conversion may take place is less than three months ahead, or the next such date (where the first has passed) is less than a year ahead; and</p></li>\r\n<li><p> the convertible is trading at a premium of less than 10%, where the premium is defined as the current mark to market value of the convertible less the mark to market value of the underlying equity, expressed as a percentage of the mark to market value of the underlying equity.</p></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>An institution\'s interest rate position risk requirement is the sum of the capital required for <em>specific risk </em>and <em>general market risk </em>for each currency in which the institution has a trading book exposure.</p>\r\n<h5>Specific Risk</h5>\r\n<p> The specific risk capital charge is calculated by multiplying the absolute values of the debt positions in the trading book by their respective risk factors.  The risk factors, as set out below in Table I, correspond to the category of the obligor and the residual maturity of the instrument. For this calculation, offsetting of long and short positions is permitted for debt positions in <strong>identical</strong> issues (including certain derivative contracts).  Even if the issuer is the same, no offsetting is permitted between different issues to arrive at a net holding since differences in currencies, coupon rates, liquidity, call features, etc., mean that prices may diverge in the short run.</p>\r\n<h6>TABLE I - Specific Risk Categories and Weights</h6>\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody><tr>\r\n<th>\r\nCategory\r\n</th>\r\n<th>\r\nRemaining Maturity [contractual]\r\n</th>\r\n<th>\r\nFactor [In percent]\r\n</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\nGovernment\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\nN/A\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n0.00\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td rowspan="3">\r\nQualifying\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n6 months or less</td>\r\n<td>0.25</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr><td>\r\n 6 to 24 months</td>\r\n \r\n <td>1.00</td>\r\n </tr>\r\n <tr>\r\n<td> over 24 months</td>\r\n<td>1.60</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\nOther\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\nN/A\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n8.00\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody></table>\r\n<p>A specific risk charge will apply to derivative contracts in the trading book only when they are based on an underlying instrument.  For example, where an interest rate swap is based on an index of Bankers Acceptance rates, there will not be a specific risk charge.  However an option based on a corporate bond will generate a specific risk charge.  Appendix 7-1-III includes examples of derivatives in the trading book that require a specific risk charge and derivatives in the trading book that do not.</p>\r\n<p>The specific risk charge for derivative contracts is calculated by multiplying:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>    the market value of the effective notional amount of the debt instrument that underlies an interest rate swap, future or forward;</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>by:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>    the specific risk factors in Table I that correspond to the category and residual term of the underlying debt instrument.</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The effective notional amount of a derivative is the market value of the stated underlying debt instrument adjusted to reflect any multiplier applicable to the contract\'s reference rate(s) or, where there is no multiplier component, simply, the market value of the stated underlying debt instrument.</p>\r\n<p>All over-the-counter derivative contracts are subject to the counterparty credit risk charges determined in accordance with Part I of this Guideline, even where a specific risk charge is required.  A specific risk requirement would arise if the derivative position was based on an underlying instrument or security.  For example, if the underlying security was a AAA rated corporate bond, the derivative will attract a specific risk requirement based on the underlying bond.  However, where the derivative was based on an underlying exposure that was an index (e.g., interbank rates), no specific risk would arise.</p>\r\n<h6>Government</h6>\r\n<p> The <em>government </em>category includes all forms of debt instruments, including but not limited to bonds, treasury bills and other short-term instruments:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>          issued by, fully guaranteed by, or fully collateralized by securities issued by central governments of the OECD-based group of countries<sup id="fnb17-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb17"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>17</a></sup>, Canadian provincial and territorial governments and agents of the federal, provincial or territorial governments in Canada whose debts are, by virtue of their enabling legislation, direct obligations of the parent government; or</p></li>\r\n<li><p>          issued by, or fully guaranteed by, non-OECD central governments and denominated in local currency of that government and funded by liabilities booked in that currency.</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h6>Qualifying</h6>\r\n<p> The <em>qualifying </em>category includes debt securities:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>          issued by, or fully guaranteed by, OECD public sector entities including Canadian public sector entities attracting a 20% risk weight under section 3.5;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>          issued by, or fully guaranteed by, a multilateral development bank<sup id="fnb18-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb18"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>18</a></sup>;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>          issued by, or fully guaranteed by, Canadian deposit-taking institutions or OECD-banks where the instrument does not qualify as capital of the issuing institution<sup id="fnb19-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb19"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>19</a></sup>;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>          issued by regulated securities firms in Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom and the United States; and</p></li>\r\n<li><p>          rated investment-grade by at least two nationally recognized credit rating services, or rated investment-grade by one nationally recognized credit rating agency and not less than investment-grade by any other credit rating agency.</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Nationally recognized credit rating agencies include but are not restricted to:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>    Dominion Bond Rating Service (DBRS);</li>\r\n<li>    Canada Bond Rating Service (CBRS);</li>\r\n<li>    Moody\'s Investor Service (Moody\'s);</li>\r\n<li>    Standard &amp; Poors (S&amp;P);</li>\r\n<li>    ICBA Banking Analysis (ICBA);</li>\r\n<li>    Japan Credit Rating Agency, LTD (JCR);</li>\r\n<li>    Nippon Investor Services Inc., (NIS); and</li>\r\n<li>   the Japan Bond Research Institute (JBRI).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Table II provides the minimum ratings constituting investment grade for the agencies listed above.</p>\r\n<h6>TABLE II - Example Minimum  Ratings Comprising Investment Grade</h6>\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody><tr>\r\n<td></td>\r\n<th colspan="2">\r\nMinimum Ratings\r\n</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>\r\nRating Agency\r\n</th>\r\n<th>\r\nSecurities\r\n</th>\r\n<th>\r\nMoney market\r\n</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\nDBRS\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\nBBB low\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\nA-3\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\nCBRS\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\nB++low\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\nR-2\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\nMoody\'s\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\nBaa3\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\nP-3\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\nS&amp;P\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\nBBB-\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\nA-3\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\nICBA\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\nBBB-\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\nA-3\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\nJCR\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\nBBB-\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\nJ-2\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\nNIS\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\nBBB-\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\na-3\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\nJBRI\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\nBBB-\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\nA-2\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody></table>\r\n<h6>Other</h6>\r\n<p> The <em>other </em>category includes debt securities not qualifying as government or qualifying securities.

The &quot;buyer&quot; of an FRA is fixing the interest rate on a deposit that it will <strong>receive</strong> in the future.  Hence, if interest rates rise, the buyer of an FRA receives the difference between the contracted rate and the new (higher) rate from the seller; that is the buyer makes a gain.

Ten percent of this matched portion is equal to $50,000 [.10 x 0.50= 0.05  ($50,000)].</p>\r\n<h6>In $ millions</h6>\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody><tr>\r\n<th>\r\nZone\r\n</th>\r\n<th>\r\nTime-band\r\n</th>\r\n<th>\r\nRisk Weighted Long Positions\r\n</th>\r\n<th>\r\nRisk Weighted (Short) Positions\r\n</th>\r\n<th>\r\nUnmatched Weighted Position\r\n</th>\r\n<th>\r\n<p>Step 1</p>\r\n<p>10% Basis risk charge</p>\r\n</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td rowspan="4">\r\n1\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n0-1 mth\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n1-3 mth\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n0.15\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n0.15 \r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\nn/a \r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n3-6 mth\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>(0.20)\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n (0.20)\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\nn/a \r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n6-12 mth\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n1.05\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>1.05\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\nn/a\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td rowspan="3">\r\n2\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n1-2 years\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n2-3 years\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n3-4 years\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n1.125\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n1.125\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\nn/a\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td rowspan="6">\r\n3\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n4-5 years\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n5-7 years\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n7-10 years\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n0.50\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n(5.625)\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n(5.125)\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n0.050\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n10-15 years\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n15-20 years\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n&gt;20 years\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td colspan="5"><strong>\r\nTOTAL</strong>\r\n</td>\r\n<td><strong>\r\n0.05</strong>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody></table>\r\n<p>Step 2 requires the calculation of the yield curve risk charge.

An institution which holds equity positions (whether long or short) in the trading book is exposed to the risk that the value of individual equity positions relative to the market may move against the institution - specific risk- and that the equity market as a whole may move against it - general risk.  The specific risk requirements recognize that individual equities are subject to issuer risk and liquidity risk, and that these risks may be reduced by portfolio diversification.  The general risk requirements set out in this section recognize offsetting positions within national markets.  A separate subsection for equity derivatives positions outlines the method for including them in the capital calculation.</p>\r\n<p>Equity risk capital requirements will apply to positions and exposures in the trading book on the following instruments:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>    common shares;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    convertible preference shares or securities</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    convertible debt securities which convert into equity instruments and are trading as equities;<sup id="fnb26-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb26"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>26</a></sup> </p></li>\r\n<li><p>    depository receipts;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    any other instruments exhibiting equity characteristics; and</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    equity derivatives or derivatives based on above securities.</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Non-convertible preference shares are to be excluded from these calculations as they are covered by the interest rate risk requirements described in section 7.1.</p>\r\n<p>Equity positions should be allocated to the country in which each equity is listed and the calculations outlined below applied to each country.  Equity securities listed in more than one country must be allocated to either (i) the country where the issuer is incorporated and listed <strong>or</strong>, (ii) the country where the security was purchased or sold, but not both.  Switching between countries is not allowed and any foreign exchange position resulting from a long or short position in an equity listed in a country other than Canada must be included in the calculation of the foreign exchange risk capital requirement.  Conversion into the institution\'s reporting currency should be done at current spot foreign exchange rates.</p>\r\n<p>Matched positions in each identical equity or stock index in each country may be fully offset, resulting in a single net short or long position to which the specific and general market risk charges will apply.</p>\r\n<h5>Specific Risk</h5>\r\n<p> The measurement of specific risk capital requirements is calculated on the basis of the institution\'s gross equity positions.  The gross position is the sum of the absolute value of all short equity positions and all long equity positions, including positions arising from derivatives, calculated at the current market value.  Long and short positions in the same share issue may be reported on a net basis.  The specific risk capital requirement is 8% of this sum.  However, if the portfolio is both liquid and well-diversified (defined below) the specific risk capital requirement may be 4% of the gross equity position.</p>\r\n<h6>Liquid and Well Diversified Portfolio</h6>\r\n<p> A portfolio that is liquid and well-diversified is characterized by a limited sensitivity to price changes of any single equity issue or closely related group of equity issues held in the portfolio. The volatility of the portfolio\'s value should not be dominated by the volatility of any individual equity issue or by equity issues from any single industry or economic sector.</p>\r\n<p>Individual equities included in the indices listed in &quot;Table I - Market Indices&quot; are considered to be liquid.

Instruments are valued at current market and a net position must be separately calculated for each country in which the institution holds equity instruments.  The capital requirement for general market risk is 8% of the net position for each country.</p>\r\n<h5>Equity Derivatives </h5>\r\n<p>Equity derivatives and other off-balance sheet positions that are affected by changes in equity prices are included in the measurement system (except for equity options, equity index options, and the associated underlying).<sup id="fnb27-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb27"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>27</a></sup> This includes futures and swaps on both individual equities and on equity indices.  Equity derivatives should be converted into notional equity positions in the relevant underlying instrument.  A summary of the rules for equity derivatives is set out in Appendix 7-2-I.</p>\r\n<h6>Calculation of Positions </h6>\r\n<p>In order to calculate the specific and general market risk, positions in derivatives should be converted into notional equity positions as follows:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>    futures and forward contracts relating to individual equities should be reported at current market price of the underlying;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    futures relating to stock indices should be reported as the marked-to-market value of the notional underlying equity portfolio;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    equity swaps are to be treated as two notional positions; and</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    equity options should be carved out together with the associated underlyings and treated under section 7.5 of this guideline.</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h6>Risk in Relation to an Index</h6>\r\n<p> A specific risk capital charge of 2% applies to the net long or short position in a contract on an index listed in Table 1 above.  This capital charge is intended to cover factors such as divergence from the general market level and execution risk.  The 2% risk weight is to apply only to well diversified indices and not, for example, to sectoral indices.  Positions in indices not listed in Table 1 must either be decomposed into their component shares, or be treated as a single position based on the sum of current market values of the underlying instruments; if treated as a single position, the specific risk requirement is the highest specific risk charge which would apply to any of the index\'s constituent shares.  An institution\'s position in an index contract is also subject to an 8% general market risk charge.</p>\r\n<h6>Futures Arbitrage</h6>\r\n<p> In the case of futures-related arbitrage strategies, the 2% specific risk charge described above may be applied to only one index with the opposite position exempt from a capital charge (both the specific and general market risk capital charges). The strategies qualifying for this treatment are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>    when the institution takes an opposite position in exactly the same index future at different dates; and</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    when the institution has an opposite position in different but similar indices at the same date, subject to supervisory oversight.</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>If an institution engages in a deliberate arbitrage strategy, in which a futures contract on a well diversified equity index matches a basket of securities, it may exclude both positions from their respective specific and general risk charges on condition that the trade has been deliberately entered into and separately controlled and the composition of the basket of stocks represents at least 90% of the market value of the index.</p>\r\n<p>In such a case, there will be a minimum capital requirement of 4% (that is, 2% of the gross value of the positions on each side) to reflect risk associated with executing the transaction.  This applies even if all of the securities comprising the index are held in identical proportions.

Institutions with significant foreign exchange positions are encouraged to use internal models.</p>\r\n<p>The capital requirement for foreign exchange risk is applied to the entire business, both the trading and non-trading books.  Two steps are required to calculate the capital requirement for foreign exchange risk.  The first is to measure the exposure in a single currency position.  The second is to calculate the capital requirement for the portfolio of positions in different currencies. In summary, the capital charge is 8% of the greater of the sum of (i) the net open long positions or (ii) the net open short positions in each currency, plus the net open position in gold, whatever the sign.<sup id="fnb28-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb28"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>28</a></sup> </p>\r\n<h5>Measuring the Exposure in a Single Currency</h5>\r\n<p> The net open position for each individual currency (and gold) is calculated by summing:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>    the net spot position (i.e., all asset items less all liability items, including accrued interest and accrued expenses, denominated in the currency in question);</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    the net forward position (i.e., all net amounts under forward foreign exchange transactions, including currency futures and the principal on currency swaps);</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    guarantees (and similar instruments) that are certain to be called and are likely to be irrecoverable;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    net future income/expenses not yet accrued but already fully hedged (at the discretion of the reporting institution); and</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    any other item representing a profit or loss in foreign currencies.</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Options on foreign exchange are treated separately; see section 7.5 of this guideline.</p>\r\n<h6>Treatment of Composite Currencies</h6>\r\n<p> For measuring an institution\'s open positions, positions in composite currencies, such as the ECU, may be treated either as a currency in their own right or split into their component parts. Institutions must be consistent in their treatment of composite currencies.</p>\r\n<h6>Treatment of Immaterial Operations</h6>\r\n<p> Foreign exchange risk is assessed on a consolidated basis.  It may be technically impractical in the case of immaterial operations to include some currency positions.  In such cases, the internal limit in each currency may be used as a proxy for the positions, provided there is adequate ex post monitoring of actual positions complying with such limits.  In these circumstances, the limits should be added, regardless of sign, to the net open position in each currency.</p>\r\n<h6>Measurement of Forward Currency Positions</h6>\r\n<p> Forward currency positions should be valued at current spot market exchange rates.  It would be inappropriate to use forward exchange rates since to some extent they reflect current interest rate differentials.  Institutions which base their normal management accounting on net present values are expected to use the net present values of each position, discounted using current interest rates and translated at current spot rates, for measuring their forward currency and gold positions.</p>\r\n<h6>Accrued and Unearned Interest, Income and Expenses </h6>\r\n<p>Accrued interest, accrued income and accrued expenses should be treated as a position if they are subject to exchange rate fluctuations.  Unearned but expected future interest, income or expenses may be included provided the amounts are certain and have been fully hedged by forward foreign exchange contracts.  Institutions must be consistent in their treatment of unearned interest, income and expenses and the institution must have written policies covering the treatment.  The selection of positions that are only beneficial to reducing the overall position will not be permitted.</p>\r\n<h6>Structural Positions </h6>\r\n<p>Structural positions and related hedges will be exempt from the calculation of net open currency positions.  Structural positions may include any of the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>    any position arising from an instrument which qualifies to be included in an institution\'s capital base;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    any position entered into in relation to the net investment of a capital nature in foreign operation, the accounting consequence of which is to reduce or eliminate what would otherwise be a movement in the foreign currency translation reserve; and</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    investments in foreign operations which are fully deducted from an institution\'s capital for capital adequacy purposes.</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5>Calculating the Capital Requirement for the Portfolio</h5>\r\n<p> The nominal amount (or net present value) of the net open position in each foreign currency (and gold) is converted at spot rates into Canadian dollars.  The capital charge is 8% of the overall net open position calculated as the sum of:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>    the greater of the sum of the net open short positions or the sum of the net open long positions (absolute values); and</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    the net open position in gold, either long or short, regardless of sign.</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5>Foreign Exchange De Minimus Criteria</h5>\r\n<p> An institution doing negligible business in foreign currency and that does not take foreign exchange positions for its own account may be exempted from the capital requirement for foreign exchange risk provided that:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>    its foreign currency business, defined as the greater of the sum of its gross long positions and the sum of its gross short positions in all foreign currencies, does not exceed 100% of eligible capital; and</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    its overall net open foreign exchange position does not exceed 2% of its eligible capital.</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5 id="ToCExchangeRisk">Appendix 7-3-I  -  Example of the Shorthand Measure of Foreign Exchange Risk</h5>\r\n<p>Institution A has the following net currency positions.

The middle line of the above chart shows the net open positions in each of the currencies.  The sum of the long positions is +300.  The sum of the short positions is -200.</p>\r\n<p>The foreign exchange market risk is calculated using the higher of the summed absolute values of either the net long or short positions, and the absolute value for the position in gold.  The capital charge is 8%.  In this example, the total long position (300) would be added to the gold position (35) to give an aggregate position of 335.  The aggregated amount multiplied by 8% would result in a capital charge of $26.80.</p>\r\n<h4 id="ToC74CommoditiesRisk">7.4    Commodities Risk</h4>\r\n<p>This section provides a minimum capital requirement to cover the market risk of holding or taking positions in commodities including precious metals but excluding gold (gold is treated as a foreign currency).  Institutions conducting a limited amount of commodities business may use the simplified measurement method that is comprised of a capital charge on the net and gross position in each category of commodity.  This method is set out below.  All other institutions must adopt an internal model system that conforms to criteria set out in chapter 8.</p>\r\n<h5>Net Position Requirement</h5>\r\n<p> Under the simplified method, each long and short commodity position (spot and forward) is expressed in terms of the standard unit of measurement (such as barrels, kilos, or grams).  The open positions in each category<sup id="fnb29-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb29"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>29</a></sup> of commodities are then converted at current spot rates into Canadian dollars, with long and short positions offset to arrive at the net open position in each commodity.  Positions in different categories of commodities may not be offset.  The base capital requirement is 15% of the net open position, long or short, in each commodity.<sup id="fnb30-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb30"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>30</a></sup> </p>\r\n<h5>Gross Position Requirement </h5>\r\n<p>To protect an institution against basis risk, interest rate risk, and forward gap risk, each category of commodity is also subject to a 3% capital requirement on the institution\'s gross positions, long plus short, in the particular commodity.</p>\r\n<h5>Calculation of Positions </h5>\r\n<p>Commodity derivatives and other off-balance-sheet positions that are affected by changes in commodity prices are included in the measurement system (except for options and the associated underlying instrument - refer to section 7.5 for a description of their treatment).  Commodity derivatives are converted into notional commodity positions using the current spot price.</p>\r\n<h4 id="ToC75Options">7.5    Options</h4>\r\n<p>Options contracts and related hedging positions in the associated underlying instrument, commodity or index, cash or forward, are subject to capital requirements as calculated in this section.</p>\r\n<p>The capital requirements calculated under this section should then be added to the capital requirements for debt securities, equities, foreign exchange, and commodities risk as appropriate.</p>\r\n<p>Two alternatives to measuring the market risk for options activities are available under the standardized approach:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>    those institutions which solely use purchased options may use the <em>simplified method</em>;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    those institutions which also write options must use the <em>scenario method</em>.<sup id="fnb31-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb31"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>31</a></sup> </p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The more significant an institution\'s trading in options, the more sophisticated the approach an institution will be expected to use.  Institutions doing business in certain classes of exotic options (e.g., barriers and digitals) may be required to use the internal models alternative as set out in chapter 8.</p>\r\n<p>Regardless of the method used, specific risk related to the issuer of an instrument still applies to options positions for equities, equity indices and corporate debt securities.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to these market risk charges, purchased options remain subject to the credit risk capital requirements specified in Part I of this Guideline.</p>\r\n<h5>Simplified method</h5>\r\n<p> An institution that has only a limited amount and range of purchased options may use the simplified method set out in Table I for individual options positions.  These options positions are subject to the separate capital charges specified in Table I and are not included in the standardized calculation of specific and general market risk specified in the preceding sections.

A similar methodology applies for options whose underlying is a foreign currency, a debt security or a commodity.  However, in the case of options on foreign exchange and options on commodities, only the risk factor for general market risk will be applied to the relevant options position.</p>\r\n<h5>Scenario Method</h5>\r\n<p> Under the scenario method, an institution is required to make separate calculations of the specific risk and general market risk of options and their related hedging positions.  Specific risk charges must be calculated on each issue in which the institution has a net option position that is subject to interest rate risk or to equity risk.  General risk charges are calculated on portfolios of options (groupings are set out below).</p>\r\n<p>The scenario method uses simulation techniques to calculate changes in the value of an options portfolio for changes in the level and volatility of the prices of its associated underlying instruments.  Under this approach, the general market risk charge is determined by the scenario &quot;matrix&quot; (i.e., the specified combination of underlying and volatility changes) that produces the largest loss.  The total general market risk capital requirement for all option portfolios is the sum of the largest losses of individual option portfolios.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to the general market risk of its interest rate and equity options portfolios, institutions using the scenario method are required to calculate the specific risk of these options using the same basic methodology in the preceding sections on interest rate position risk and equity risk.</p>\r\n<h6>Calculating the General Market Risk</h6>\r\n<p> An institution constructs a two-dimensional matrix for each of its options portfolios.  Options portfolios include options and any related hedging positions grouped together as follows:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>    for interest rates, options on underlying instruments whose residual maturity is bounded by one of at least six groups of time bands from Table II of this section where no more than three contiguous time bands are grouped together;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    for equities and equity indices, each national market;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    for foreign currencies and gold, each currency pair and gold and;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    for commodities, each individual commodity.</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The first dimension of each matrix requires the institution to evaluate the portfolio over a specified range above and below the current value of the underlying instrument, commodity, or index.  For interest rates the range is consistent with the assumed changes in yield for the time bands in Table II.  Institutions should use the highest of the assumed changes in yield applicable to the time bands that it groups together.  The time bands and assumed changes in yield are:</p>\r\n<h6>Table II</h6>\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody><tr>\r\n<th>\r\nTime band\r\n</th>\r\n<th>\r\nAssumed changes in yield\r\n</th>\r\n<th>\r\nTime band\r\n</th>\r\n<th>\r\nAssumed changes in yield\r\n</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\nup to 1 month\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n1.00\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n3 up to 4 years\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n0.75\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n1 up to 3 months\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n1.00\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n4 up to 5 years\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n0.75\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n3 up to 6 months\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n1.00\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n5 up to 7 years\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n0.70\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n6 up to 12 months\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n1.00\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n7 up to 10 years\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n0.65\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n1 up to 2 years\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n0.90\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n10 up to 15 years\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n0.60\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n2 up to 3 years\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n0.80\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n15 up to 20 years\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n0.60\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td></td>\r\n<td></td>\r\n<td>\r\nover 20 years\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n0.60\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody></table>\r\n<p>The other ranges are \xc2\xb18 per cent for equities, \xc2\xb18 per cent for foreign exchange and gold, and \xc2\xb115 per cent for commodities.</p>\r\n<p>For all option portfolios, at least seven observations (including the current observation) should be used to divide the range into equally spaced intervals.</p>\r\n<p>The second dimension of the matrix entails a change in the volatility of the underlying rate or price equal to \xc2\xb1 25 per cent of the current volatility.<sup id="fnb36-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb36"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>36</a></sup> </p>\r\n<p>The application of the scenario method, particularly regarding the precise way the analysis is constructed, will be subject to review by OSFI.

Set out below are qualitative criteria that institutions would have to meet before they are permitted to use a models-based approach.  Only those institutions whose models are in full compliance with the qualitative criteria will be eligible for application of the minimum multiplication factor (see section 8.4).</p>\r\n<p>The qualitative criteria include:</p>\r\n<ol class="list-lower-alpha">\r\n<li><p>The institution should have an independent risk control unit that is responsible for the design and implementation of the institution\'s risk management system.  The unit should produce and analyze daily reports on the output of the institution\'s risk measurement model, including an evaluation of the relationship between measures of risk exposure and trading limits.  This unit must be independent from business trading units and should report directly to senior management of the institution.</p></li>\r\n<li><p>The unit must conduct a regular back-testing program, i.e., an ex post comparison of the risk measure generated by the model against actual daily changes in portfolio value over longer periods of time.  Initially, the unit should make these comparisons using actual next-day portfolio profits and losses.  Over time, they are expected to develop the ability to make comparisons against changes in value based on static positions.  Where backtesting is based on comparisons against static positions, institutions should still track daily portfolio profits and losses to assure a strong understanding of the link between calculated measures of risk and trading outcomes.  The back-testing program should be applied as appropriate to the aggregate risks measured by the models as well as on an individual book level that corresponds to the structure of VaR limits and disaggregated profit and loss information.</p></li>\r\n<li><p>Board of directors and senior management should be actively involved in the risk control process and must regard risk control as an essential aspect of its business to which significant resources need to be devoted.  In this regard, the daily reports prepared by the independent risk control unit must be reviewed by a level of management with sufficient seniority and authority to enforce both reductions of positions taken by individual traders and reductions in the institution\'s overall risk exposure.</p></li>\r\n<li><p>The institution\'s internal risk measurement model must be closely integrated into the day- to-day risk management process of the institution.  Its output should accordingly be an integral part of the process of planning, monitoring and controlling the institution\'s market risk profile.</p></li>\r\n<li><p>The risk measurement system should be used in conjunction with internal trading and exposure limits.  While trading limits for individual dealers do not need to be explicitly stated in terms of value-at-risk, trading limits should be related to the institution\'s risk measurement model in a manner that is consistent over time and that is well understood by both traders and senior management.</p></li>\r\n<li><p>A routine and rigorous program of stress testing should be in place as a supplement to the risk analysis based on the day-to-day output of the institution\'s risk measurement model. The results of stress testing should be reviewed periodically by senior management and should be reflected in the policies and limits set by management and the board of directors. Where stress tests reveal particular vulnerability to a given set of circumstances, prompt steps should be taken to manage those risks appropriately.</p></li>\r\n<li><p>Institutions should have a routine in place for ensuring compliance with a documented set of internal policies, controls and procedures concerning the risk measurement system. The institution\'s risk measurement system must be well documented, for example through a risk management manual that describes the basic principles of the risk management system and that provides an explanation of the empirical techniques used to measure market risk.</p></li>\r\n<li><p>An independent review of the risk measurement system should be carried out regularly in the institution\'s own internal auditing process.  This review should include both the activities of the business trading units and of the independent risk control unit.  A review of the overall risk management process should take place at regular intervals (ideally not less than once a year) and should specifically address, at a minimum the:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>    adequacy of the documentation of the risk management system and process;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    organization of the risk control unit;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    integration of market risk measures into daily risk management;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    approval process for risk pricing models and valuation systems used by front and back-office personnel;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    validation of any significant change in the risk measurement process;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    scope of market risks captured by the risk measurement model;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    integrity of the management information system;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    accuracy and completeness of position data;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    verification of the consistency, timeliness and reliability of data sources used to run internal models, including the independence of such data sources;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    accuracy and appropriateness of volatility and correlation assumptions;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    accuracy of valuation and risk factor calculations; and</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    verification of the model\'s accuracy through frequent back-testing as described in (b) above.</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h4 id="ToC83SpecificationofMarketRiskFactors">8.3    Specification of Market Risk Factors</h4>\r\n<p>An important part of an institution\'s internal market risk measurement system is the specification of an appropriate set of market risk factors, i.e., the market rates and prices that affect the value of the institution\'s trading positions.  The risk factors contained in a market risk measurement system should be sufficient to capture the risks inherent in the institution\'s portfolio of on- and off-balance sheet trading positions.  In specifying the risk factors for their internal models, institutions should meet the guidelines set out below:</p>\r\n<h5>Interest rates</h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>    There must be a set of risk factors corresponding to interest rates in each currency in which the institution has interest-rate-sensitive on- or off-balance sheet positions.</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    The risk measurement system should model the yield curve using one of a number of generally accepted approaches, for example by estimating forward rates of zero coupon yields.  The yield curve should be divided into various maturity segments in order to capture variation in the volatility of rates along the yield curve; there will typically be one risk factor corresponding to each maturity segment.  For material exposures to interest rate movements in the major currencies and markets, institutions must model the yield curve using a minimum of six risk factors.  However, the number of risk factors used should ultimately be driven by the nature of the institution\'s trading strategies.  For instance, an institution with a portfolio of various types of securities across many points of the yield curve and that engages in complex arbitrage strategies would require a greater number of risk factors to capture interest rate risk accurately.</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    The risk measurement system must incorporate separate risk factors to capture spread risk (e.g., between bonds and swaps).  A variety of approaches may be used to capture the spread risk arising from less than perfectly correlated movements between government and other fixed-income interest rates, such as specifying a completely separate yield curve for non-government fixed-income instruments (for instance, swaps or municipal securities) or estimating the spread over government rates at various points along the yield curve.</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5>Exchange Rates</h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>    The risk measurement system should incorporate risk factors corresponding to the individual foreign currencies in which the institution\'s positions are denominated.  Since the value-at-risk figure calculated by the risk measurement system will be expressed in the institution\'s domestic currency, any net position denominated in a foreign currency will introduce a foreign exchange risk.  Thus, there must be risk factors corresponding to the exchange rate between the domestic currency and each foreign currency in which the institution has a significant exposure.</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5>Equity Prices</h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>    There should be risk factors corresponding to each of the equity markets in which the institution holds significant positions.</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    At a minimum, there should be a risk factor that is designed to capture market-wide movements in equity prices (e.g., a market index).  Positions in individual securities or in sector indices could be expressed in &quot;beta-equivalents&quot;<sup id="fnb37-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb37"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>37</a></sup> relative to this market-wide index.</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    A somewhat more detailed approach would be to have risk factors corresponding to various sectors of the overall equity market (for instance, industry sectors or cyclical and non-cyclical sectors).  As above, positions in individual stocks within each sector could be expressed in beta-equivalents<sup id="fnb11b-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb11"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>11</a></sup> relative to the sector index.</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    The most extensive approach would be to have risk factors corresponding to the volatility of individual equity issues.</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    The sophistication and nature of the modelling technique for a given market should correspond to the institution\'s exposure to the overall market as well as its concentration in individual equity issues in that market.</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5>Commodity Prices</h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>    There should be risk factors corresponding to each of the commodity markets in which the institution holds significant positions.</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    For institutions with relatively limited positions in commodity-based instruments, a straightforward specification of risk factors would be acceptable.  Such a specification would likely entail one risk factor for each commodity price to which the institution is exposed.  In cases where the aggregate positions are quite small, it might be acceptable to use a single risk factor for a relatively broad class of commodities (for instance, a single risk factor for all types of oil).</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    For more active trading the model should encompass:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>    directional risk, to capture the exposure from changes in spot prices arising from net open positions;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    forward gap and interest rate risk, to capture the exposure to changes in forward prices arising from maturity mismatches;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    basis risk, to capture the exposure to changes in the price relationships between two similar, but not identical, commodities; and</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    the model must also take account of variation in the &quot;convenience yield&quot;<sup id="fnb38-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb38"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>38</a></sup> between derivatives positions, such as forwards and swaps, and cash positions in the commodity.</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4 id="ToC84QuantitativeStandards">8.4    Quantitative Standards</h4>\r\n<p>Institutions will have flexibility in devising the precise nature of their models, but the following minimum standards will apply for the purpose of calculating their capital charge:</p>\r\n<ol class="list-lower-alpha">\r\n<li><p>&quot;value at risk&quot; should be computed on a daily basis.</p></li>\r\n<li><p>in calculating the value-at-risk, a 99th percentile, one-tailed confidence interval is to be used.</p></li>\r\n<li><p>in calculating value-at-risk, the minimum holding period will be ten trading days.  For positions that display linear price characteristics (but not options), institutions may use value-at-risk numbers calculated according to shorter holding periods scaled up to ten days by the square root of time (for the treatment of options, also see (h)<span class="wb-invisible">, Text for screen readers: h = 8,</span> below).</p></li>\r\n<li><p>the historical observation period (sample period) for calculating value-at-risk will be constrained to a minimum length of one year.  For institutions that use a weighting scheme or other methods for the historical observation period, the &quot;effective&quot; observation period must be at least one year (that is, the weighted average duration of all daily time series data should be no less than 6 months).</p></li>\r\n<li><p>institutions should update their data sets no less frequently than one every three months and should also reassess them whenever market prices are subject to material changes. OSFI may also require an institution to calculate its value-at-risk using a shorter observation period if, in OSFI\'s judgement, this is justified by a significant upsurge in price volatility.</p></li>\r\n<li><p>no particular type of model is prescribed.  So long as each model used captures all the material risks run by the institution, as set out in section 8.3, institutions will be free to use models based on variance-covariance matrices, historical simulations, or Monte Carlo simulations.</p></li>\r\n<li><p>institutions will have discretion to recognize empirical correlations within broad risk categories (e.g., interest rates, exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices, including related options volatilities in each risk factor category).  OSFI may also recognize empirical correlations across broad risk factor categories, provided OSFI is satisfied that the institution\'s system for measuring correlations is sound and implemented with integrity.</p></li>\r\n<li><p>institutions\' models must accurately capture the unique risks associated with options within each of the broad risk categories.  The following criteria apply to the measurement of options risks:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>    institutions\' models must capture the non-linear price characteristics of options positions;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>    institutions are expected to ultimately move towards the application of a full 10 day price shock to options positions or positions that display option-like characteristics. In the interim, OSFI will accept estimates of less than a 10 day price shock that are adjusted to an equivalent 10 day price shock using a square root of time adjustment;</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>and</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>    each institution\'s risk measurement system must have a set of risk factors that captures the volatilities of the rates and prices underlying option positions, i.e., vega risk.  Institutions with relatively large and/or complex options portfolios should have detailed specifications of the relevant volatilities.  This means that institutions should measure the volatilities of the options positions broken down by different maturities.</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p> each institution must meet, on a daily basis, a capital requirement expressed as the higher of (i) the previous day\'s value-at-risk number measured according to the parameters specified in this section and (ii) an average of the daily value-at-risk measures on each of the preceding sixty business days multiplied by 3.  OSFI may require institutions to add to this factor a &quot;plus&quot; directly related to the ex-post performance of the model derived from the outcome of &quot;back-testing&quot; and be zero when such results are satisfactory.</p></li>\r\n<li><p> institutions using models will be subject to a separate capital charge to cover the specific risk of interest rate related instruments and equity securities<sup id="fnb39-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb39"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>39</a></sup> as defined in sections 7.1 and 7.2 to the extent that this risk is not incorporated into their models.

The standards for event risk and default risk shall be determined after consultation with the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision.</p>\r\n<p>Event risk is the risk of loss in the value of claims against a borrower or security issuer when that issuer experiences an event other than default which so greatly modifies net worth or future earnings prospects of the issuer that the market value of the securities is sharply reduced. Default risk is narrowly defined as the risk of loss in the value of claims against a borrower or security issuer when that borrower has insufficient asset to meet its obligations or is otherwise prevent from meeting its obligations in a timely manner.  Default risk does not include the loss resulting from downgrades in creditworthiness.</p>\r\n<h5>Backtesting</h5>\r\n<p>Institutions must have in place a process to analyze exceptions identified through the backtesting of sub-portfolios of specific risk.  There will be a presumption that models that incorporate specific risk are &quot;unacceptable&quot; if the results at the sub-portfolio level produce a number of exceptions commensurate with the Red Zone as defined in the document, <em>Supervisory framework for the use of backtesting in conjunction with the internal models approach to market risk capital requirements</em>, issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in April 1996.</p>\r\n<h4 id="ToC86StressTesting">8.6    Stress Testing</h4>\r\n<p>Institutions that use the internal models approach for meeting market risk capital requirements must have in place a rigorous and comprehensive stress testing program.  Stress testing to identify events or influences that could greatly impact institutions is a key component of an institution\'s assessment of its capital position.</p>\r\n<p>Institutions\' stress scenarios need to cover a range of factors that can create extraordinary losses or gains in trading books, or make the control of risk in those books very difficult.  These factors include low-probability events in all major types of risks, including the various components of market, credit, and operational risks.  Stress scenarios need to shed light on the impact of such events on positions that display both linear and non-linear price characteristics (i.e., options and instruments that have options-like characteristics).</p>\r\n<p>Institutions\' stress tests should be both of a quantitative and qualitative nature, incorporating both market risk and liquidity aspects of market disturbances.  Quantitative criteria should identify plausible stress scenarios to which institutions could be exposed.  Qualitative criteria should emphasize that two major goals of stress testing are to evaluate the capacity of the institution\'s capital to absorb potential large losses and to identify steps the institution can take to reduce its risk and conserve capital.  This assessment is integral to setting and evaluating the institution\'s management strategy and the results of stress testing should be routinely communicated to senior management and, periodically, to the institution\'s board of directors.</p>\r\n<p>Institutions should combine the use of supervisory stress scenarios with stress tests developed by institutions themselves to reflect their specific risk characteristics.  Specifically, OSFI may ask institutions to provide information on stress testing in three broad areas:</p>\r\n<h5>(a) Supervisory scenarios requiring no simulations by the institution</h5>\r\n<p>Institutions should have information on the largest losses experienced during the reporting period available for supervisory review.  This loss information could be compared to the level of capital that results from an institution\'s internal measurement system.  For example, it could provide OSFI with the coverage ratio of reported VaR capital to the maximum one day loss during the reporting period.</p>\r\n<h5>(b) Scenarios requiring a simulation by the institution</h5>\r\n<p>Institutions should subject their portfolios to a series of simulated stress scenarios and provide OSFI with the results [quarterly].  These scenarios could include testing the current portfolio against past periods of significant disturbance, for example the 1987 equity crash, the ERM crises of 1992 and 1993 or the fall in bond markets in the first quarter of 1994 incorporating both the large price movements and the sharp reduction in liquidity associated with these events.  A second type of scenario would evaluate the sensitivity of the institution\'s market risk exposure to changes in the assumptions about volatilities and correlations.  Applying this test would require an evaluation of the historical range of variation for volatilities and correlations and evaluation of the institution\'s current positions against the extreme values of the historical range.  Due consideration should be given to the sharp variation that at times has occurred in a matter of days in periods of significant market disturbance.  The 1987 equity crash, the suspension of the ERM, or the fall in bond markets in the first quarter of 1994, for example, all involved correlations within risk factors approaching the extreme values of 1 or -1 for several days at the height of the disturbance.</p>\r\n<h5>(c) Scenarios developed by the institution itself to capture the specific characteristics of its portfolio</h5>\r\n<p>In addition to the scenarios prescribed by OSFI under (a) and (b) above, an institution should also develop its own stress tests which it identifies as most adverse based on the characteristics of its portfolio (e.g., problems in a key region of the world combined with a sharp move in oil prices).  Institutions should provide OSFI with a description of the methodology used to identify and carry out the scenarios as well as with a description of the results derived from these scenarios.</p>\r\n<p>The results should be reviewed periodically by senior management and should be reflected in the policies and limits set by management and the board of directors.  Moreover, if the testing reveals particular vulnerability to a given set of circumstances, OSFI would expect the institution to take prompt steps to manage those risks appropriately (e.g., by hedging against that outcome or reducing the size of its exposures).</p>\r\n<h4 id="ToC87ModelValidation">8.7    Model Validation</h4>\r\n<p>In reviewing the institution\'s internal model OSFI will also require assurance that:</p>\r\n<ol class="list-lower-alpha">\r\n<li><p>the internal validation processes described in section 8.2(h) are operating in a satisfactory manner;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>the formulae used in the calculation process as well as for the pricing of options and other complex instruments are validated by a qualified unit, which in all cases should be independent from the trading area;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>the structure of internal models is adequate with respect to the institution\'s activities and geographical coverage;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>the results of the institutions\' back-testing of its internal measurement system (i.e., comparing value-at-risk estimates with actual profits and losses) ensure that the model provides a reliable measure of potential losses over time.  The results as well as the underlying inputs to their value-at-risk calculations should be available to OSFI and external auditors on request;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>data flows and processes associated with the risk measurement system are transparent and accessible.  In particular, it is necessary that auditors or OSFI are in a position to have easy access, whenever they judge it necessary and under appropriate procedures, to the models\' specifications and parameters.</p></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h4 id="ToC88CombinationofInternalModelsandTheStandardizedMethodology">8.8    Combination of Internal Models and The Standardized Methodology</h4>\r\n<p>Unless an institution\'s exposure to a particular risk factor, such as commodity prices, is insignificant, the internal measurement system will in principle require institutions to have an integrated risk measurement system that captures the broad risk factor categories (i.e., interest rates, exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices, with related options volatilities being included in each risk factor category).  Thus, institutions which start to use models for one or more risk factor categories will, over time, be expected to extend the models to all their market risks.  An institution which has developed one or more models will no longer be able to revert to measuring the risk measured by those models according to the standardized methodology (unless OSFI withdraws approval for that models).  However, pending further experience regarding the process of changing to a models-based approach, no specific time limit will be set for institutions that use a combination of internal models and the standardized methodology to move to a comprehensive model.</p>\r\n<p>The following conditions apply to institutions using such combinations:</p>\r\n<ol class="list-lower-alpha">\r\n<li><p>subject to transitional arrangements, each broad risk factor category must be assessed using a single approach (either internal models or the standardized approach), i.e., no combination of the two methods will be permitted within a risk category or across the institutions\' different entities for the same type of risk;<sup id="fnb45-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb45"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>45</a></sup> </p></li>\r\n<li><p>all criteria laid down in this chapter will apply to the models being used;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>institutions may not switch from a model to the standardized approach unless OSFI rescinds permission to use the model for capital adequacy purposes;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>no element of market risk may escape measurement, i.e., the exposure for all the various risk factors, whether calculated according to the standardized approach or internal models, would have to be captured;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>the capital charges assessed under the standardized approach and under the models approach are to be aggregated according to the simple sum method.</p></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>On a case by case basis, OSFI may permit short term transitional arrangements for using a combination of internal models and the standardized approach for any risk across all of an institution\'s operations.  Approval of these temporary arrangements will be subject to:</p>\r\n<ol class="list-lower-alpha">\r\n<li><p>the institution providing adequate internal controls that prevent switching of business between legal entities to achieve the most advantageous capital charge;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>the Superintendent imposing an additional capital requirement which may be amended periodically depending on the circumstances of the transitional arrangements.

Introduction</h4>\r\n<p>Credit derivatives are off balance sheet financial instruments used to assume or mitigate the credit risk of loans and other assets.  Institutions may employ these products either as end-users (purchasing credit protection or acquiring credit exposure from third parties) or as dealers intermediating credit risk between buyers and sellers.  Refer to Annex 1 for additional background.</p>\r\n<p>This Appendix addresses the capital requirements of three major product types: total rate of return products, credit default products, and credit-linked notes.  All of these products are described in greater detail in Annex 2.  Other types of credit derivatives will not be eligible for capital relief under this guidance.</p>\r\n<h4 id="ToCBGeneralCriteriaforRiskTransfer">B.  General Criteria for Risk Transfer</h4>\r\n<p>There are two main criteria that determine the capital recognition given to the transfer of credit risk:</p>\r\n<ol class="list-lower-roman">\r\n<li><p>  the effectiveness of the risk transfer; and</p></li>\r\n<li><p> the permanence of the transfer.</p></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>To achieve an effective risk transfer, the credit derivative must:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>         protect against deterioration in value or credit loss in the event of default on the asset held on the institution\'s balance sheet; and</p></li>\r\n<li><p>         be explicit, irrevocable, unconditional and legally enforceable.</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>To achieve a prudent level of permanence to the transfer of credit risk, the credit derivative must:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>         have a minimum term for recognizing any hedging effect; and</p></li>\r\n<li><p>         be subject to a capital charge for the unhedged forward credit risk (roll-off risk) arising from maturity mismatches.</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4 id="ToCCCapitalTreatmentBankingBook">C.  Capital Treatment - Banking Book</h4>\r\n<p>Under OSFI\'s current capital adequacy framework for deposit-taking institutions (DTI\xe2\x80\x99s), the risk weight applied to a loan in the banking book can be reduced either by obtaining eligible collateral or by acquiring a qualifying guarantee.  This section outlines conditions for applying guarantee treatment to credit derivatives in the banking book.</p>\r\n<h5>Guarantor Treatment</h5>\r\n<p> An institution that provides (sells) credit protection (the guarantor) through a credit derivative becomes exposed to the credit risk of the reference asset.  For supervisory purposes, the exposure should be treated as if it were a guarantee or direct credit substitute on the reference asset.</p>\r\n<p>The guarantee treatment is applied to all credit derivatives in the banking book, except for credit derivative contracts that incorporate periodic payments for depreciation and appreciation in the value of swap contracts (primarily total-rate-of-return swaps).  In these cases, the guarantor, or provider of protection, can deduct the amount of depreciation paid to the beneficiary from the notional amount of the contract in determining the amount of exposure subject to a capital charge.</p>\r\n<h5>Beneficiary Treatment</h5>\r\n<p> An institution that receives the guarantee or buys credit protection (the beneficiary) may reduce the risk weight of the underlying asset to that of the guarantor (seller of credit protection) if the transfer of risk is effective and achieves an adequate level of permanence (see Exceptional Circumstances, below).</p>\r\n<p>For credit derivatives that are funded through a cash deposit with, or by providing eligible collateral to, the beneficiary institution (usually credit-linked notes), the risk weight of the corresponding underlying (owned) asset is lowered to that of the collateral or the guarantor.  In cases involving cash deposits, the cash is treated as collateral as outlined in section 5.1.</p>\r\n<h5>Exceptional Circumstances - (Guarantor/Beneficiary)</h5>\r\n<p>Although a guarantee is the best analogy to a credit derivative, a number of credit derivative products have features that distinguish them from traditional guarantee products.  The following sections contain guidance on the treatment of credit derivatives with such features.</p>\r\n<h6>Credit Events</h6>\r\n<p> The specification of credit events can dramatically affect the effectiveness of the risk transfer associated with credit derivatives.  The criterion for credit derivatives establishes that the contracts must be explicit, irrevocable, unconditional and legally enforceable; however, differences between regulatory recognition and market terms may exist.</p>\r\n<p>For regulatory recognition, credit events specified in the contracts must, at a minimum, include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>     failure to pay any amounts due according to the terms of the assets specified;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>     a reduction in the rate of interest or amount of interest payable or the amount of interest accrued;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>     a reduction in the amount of principal or premium payable;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>     a change in the ranking of any obligation causing subordination of the obligation;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>     repudiation;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>     filing for bankruptcy or protection from creditors;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>     distressed restructuring; and</p></li>\r\n<li><p>     cross-default or cross-acceleration.</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>If the terms of the credit derivative define credit events so as to limit the degree of credit risk transfer, then the beneficiary institution cannot reduce the risk weight of the underlying asset to that of the guarantor.  One such example occurs with restrictive definitions of credit events, such as materiality thresholds that require a high percentage of loss to occur before the guarantor is obliged to make payment.  In these cases, the degree of risk transfer is significantly limited. Consequently, the products are ineligible for guarantee treatment by the beneficiary and the beneficiary would continue to hold capital against the underlying asset.</p>\r\n<h6>Retained Risk</h6>\r\n<p> Beneficiary institutions retain risk in a credit derivative transaction when they would be required to absorb any loss or de-value the underlying asset prior to the guarantor settling the contract. Risk is also retained if the amount of protection can be reduced by a threshold amount of losses. Under such circumstances, the beneficiary institution will have to deduct the total amount of retained risk from capital on a dollar for dollar basis.   This deduction is equivalent to that applied in asset securitization and synthetic securitization transactions.</p>\r\n<h6>Asset Mismatches</h6>\r\n<p> Institutions providing (selling) credit protection through a credit derivative must hold capital against this guarantee based on the risk weight of the reference asset.</p>\r\n<p>In some instances, the reference asset in the credit derivative transaction may not be identical to the balance sheet asset (i.e., underlying asset) for which the beneficiary has acquired credit protection.  In such cases, the underlying asset can still be considered guaranteed by the beneficiary for capital purposes as long as the following three conditions are met:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>     the underlying asset and the reference asset are both obligations of the same legal entity;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>     the reference asset has the same or a more junior level of seniority than the underlying asset in bankruptcy; and</p></li>\r\n<li><p>     both assets are subject to mutual cross-default or cross acceleration provisions.</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>When the reference asset is different from the underlying asset, the risk weight to be applied by the beneficiary will be the higher of their respective risk weights.</p>\r\n<h6>Quality of Guarantor</h6>\r\n<p> If the senior unsecured debt rating of the provider of a credit derivative is lower than the equivalent of a single A rating, the beneficiary may not treat the underlying asset as guaranteed. This condition would be applied on the same basis as the qualifying category for debt securities under Part II of this Guideline.</p>\r\n<h6>Multiple Names</h6>\r\n<p> Some credit derivatives provide credit protection for a group or basket of reference assets and call for the guarantor to absorb losses on only the first asset that defaults (known as \xe2\x80\x9cfirst-to- default\xe2\x80\x9d credit protection).  In such cases, the credit protection for the remaining assets ceases to exist once the first asset in the group defaults.  A guarantor institution providing first-to-default credit protection must assign the contract\'s notional amount of credit exposure (single highest payout amount) to the highest risk-weighted asset(s) in the basket and hold capital accordingly. For the beneficiary, the asset of the lowest risk-weighted amount in the basket may be treated as guaranteed, but only if its risk-weighted amount is less than or equal to the notional amount of the credit derivative.</p>\r\n<h6>Maturity Mismatches</h6>\r\n<p> Residual maturity is the time remaining to the contractual maturity of the credit derivative. When a credit derivative includes a call option or step-up clause (an increase in the cost of the protection), its residual maturity will be assumed to be the period remaining to the earlier of the call option or step-up dates.  Effective maturity of the underlying asset is the longest possible remaining time before the obligor is scheduled to fulfil the obligation.</p>\r\n<p>A maturity mismatch occurs when the residual maturity of a hedge is less than that of the underlying exposure.  While, in general, it is preferable that the credit derivative and underlying asset are of the same maturity, there may be sound economic and risk management reasons for acquiring mismatched protection.</p>\r\n<p>Where the residual maturity of the credit derivative is less than the effective maturity of the underlying asset, recognition of the protection will depend on the residual maturity of the credit derivative.  Where there is no maturity mismatch, regardless of tenure, the recognition of the protection from the credit derivative will result in a reduction in the risk weighting of the underlying.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Maturities Under One Year:</strong>  Where the residual maturity of the credit derivative is less than one year, no reduction in required capital will be permitted.  For example, an underlying asset maturing in two years supported by a credit derivative with a residual maturity of six months would not receive any reduction in risk weighting.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Maturities Over One Year:</strong>  Where the residual maturity of the credit derivative is greater than one year and the effective maturity of the underlying asset is greater than the residual maturity of the credit derivative, the amount of credit protection provided is a function of the maturity mismatch \xe2\x80\x93 the shorter the mismatch, the greater the credit protection, all else being equal.  In effect, the beneficiary calculates the risk-weighted amount of its position as the weighted average of: (i) the amount using the risk weight of the guarantor (i.e., the risk-weighted amount of a covered position in the underlying asset if there were no maturity mismatch), and (ii) the amount using the risk weight of the underlying asset (i.e., the risk-weighted amount of an uncovered position in the underlying asset), where the weights are equal to the relative duration of the covered and uncovered positions relative to the duration of the underlying asset.</p>\r\n<p>This calculation applies where the notional amount of the credit derivative is equal to the notional amount of the underlying asset.  Where this is not the case, the amount by which the notional amount of the underlying asset exceeds that of the credit derivative would attract the risk weight that would apply to the underlying asset in the normal course.</p>\r\n<p>The adjusted risk weight for positions involving maturity-mismatched credit derivatives (but only up to the notional amount of the credit derivative if it is less than that of the underlying asset) is represented in formulae as follows:</p>\r\n<div class="align-center">\r\n<img alt="Not yet defined" src="/Eng/PublishingImages/A3formula1.png" />\r\n\xc2\xa0</div>\r\n<p>where:</p>\r\n<dl>\r\n<dt><em>r</em>**</dt>\r\n<dd><p>is the risk weight of the mismatched position;</p></dd>\r\n<dt><em>r</em></dt>\r\n<dd><p>is the risk weight on the uncovered position;</p></dd>\r\n<dt><em>r</em>*</dt>\r\n<dd><p>is the risk weight if the position had been covered without a maturity mismatch;</p></dd>\r\n<dt><em>t</em></dt>\r\n<dd><p>is the residual maturity of the credit derivative; and</p></dd>\r\n<dt><em>T</em></dt>\r\n<dd><p>is the effective maturity of the underlying asset (t \xe2\x89\xa4 T).</p></dd>\r\n</dl>\r\n<h4 id="ToCDCapitalTreatmentTradingBook">D.  Capital Treatment - Trading Book</h4>\r\n<p>All credit derivatives held in the trading book are subject to counterparty credit risk capital requirements.  Most credit derivative products are also subject to general market risk capital requirements and to the specific risk capital requirement of the reference asset.  This specific risk associated with a credit derivative is equivalent to that associated with a cash position in the reference asset (i.e., a loan or bond).  Definitions for counterparty credit risk, specific risk, and general market risk are the same as those found in Part II of this Guideline.</p>\r\n<p>Under current capital adequacy guidelines, institutions calculate their trading book market risk requirements using either an approved model or the standardized approach.  Trading book treatment of many credit derivatives that reference loans, however, raises additional issues that are not explicitly addressed in the current guidelines.  Market risk capital requirements were premised on assumptions about accurate valuation and effective tradability that may not be appropriate for bank loans and loan-based credit derivatives.  Accordingly, an institution that believes its unique circumstances justify booking loans or loan-based credit derivatives in its trading account should, in advance, provide its Relationship Manager with a detailed justification that addresses, among other things, the nature of the trading activity, the ability to fair value the instruments on a daily basis, and the availability of a history of price movements over a relevant time frame.  Where such instruments are included in the trading book for capital purposes, OSFI may, based on its review of the justification provided, increase the institution\xe2\x80\x99s capital requirements for this activity if the determination of price or liquidity presents additional risks.</p>\r\n<p>The calculation of counterparty credit risk requirements is the same whether institutions use the standardized or models approach.  Guidance on calculating the counterparty credit risk of credit derivatives in the trading book and on using the standardized and models approaches for calculating the general and specific risk of credit derivatives is provided below.</p>\r\n<h5>Counterparty Credit Risk</h5>\r\n<p> Part I of this Guideline requires a counterparty credit risk charge that is calculated by adding:</p>\r\n<ol class="list-lower-roman">\r\n<li><p>  the replacement cost (mark-to-market value) of the derivative; and</p></li>\r\n<li><p> the potential future exposure, which is the result of multiplying the notional principal amount of the derivative by an add-on factor (the add-on factor to be used depends on the type and maturity of the derivative transaction).</p></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The appropriate add-on factor to use to calculate the potential future exposure to counterparty credit risk depends on whether the reference asset is a qualifying asset under section 7.1.  For qualifying reference assets, the equity add-ons will be applied for the appropriate maturity.  For non-qualifying reference assets, an equity add-on may still be used where the counterparty has posted high quality eligible collateral (i.e., collateral which attracts a 0% risk weight as defined in section 5.1).  The commodity add-on factor is to be used when the reference asset does not meet the qualifying definitions.  Add-on factors can be referenced in section 4.3.</p>\r\n<p>For a <em>total rate of return product</em>, each party relies on the other for payment; therefore, each party records a counterparty credit risk charge.  The counterparty credit risk for <em>credit default swaps </em>is determined on the same basis as any other over-the-counter option contract.  The beneficiary of the swap relies on the guarantor to pay if a credit event occurs and, therefore, must record a counterparty credit risk charge against the guarantor.  The guarantor in the swap is exposed to the beneficiary only if there are future premiums or interest related payments. Although such swaps do not require counterparty credit risk calculations by the guarantor, the guarantor must record an exposure to the reference asset.  In <em>credit-linked notes</em>, there is no counterparty credit risk charge.</p>\r\n<h5>Standardized Approach </h5>\r\n<p>This section applies to institutions that calculate their market risk requirements using the standardized methodology.  Product descriptions and cash flow schematics are provided in Annex 2.</p>\r\n<p><em>Total rate of return swaps </em>are represented as two legs of a single transaction.  The first leg is a notional position in the reference asset to which the corresponding general and specific risk charges apply.  The second leg, representing interest payments under the swap, is recorded as a notional position in an OECD government bond with the appropriate fixed or floating rate.</p>\r\n<p><em>Credit default swaps/products </em>are represented as a notional position in the reference asset but are subject only to a specific risk charge.  For such products, there is no general market risk position created in the reference asset.  If periodic premium or interest payments are required under the swap, these cash flows are represented as a notional position in an OECD government bond with the appropriate fixed or floating rate.</p>\r\n<p><em>Credit-linked notes </em>are treated as a position in the note itself, with an embedded credit default product.  The credit-linked note has specific risk of the issuer and general market risk according to the coupon or interest rate of the note.  The embedded credit default product creates a notional position in the specific risk of the reference asset.</p>\r\n<h6>Specific Risk</h6>\r\n<p> In almost all credit derivatives (including total rate of return swaps, credit default products and credit-linked notes) specific risk is created in the reference asset.  When the credit derivative is for a single reference asset, the beneficiary creates a short position in the reference asset, while the guarantor creates a long position in the reference asset.  For some credit-linked note products or other products in which the guarantor funds the beneficiary (posts cash or collateral), a long specific risk position in the note issuer, in the amount of the collateral, is also created.</p>\r\n<p>The specific risk capital charge is calculated by multiplying the absolute values of the derivative positions (mark-to-market) in the trading book by their respective risk factors.  Risk factors are outlined in Part II of this Guideline.  Institutions generally will apply factors based upon the section on debt instruments, which takes into account the category (government, qualifying, or non-qualifying) and the residual maturity (six months to two years).</p>\r\n<h6>Multiple Names</h6>\r\n<p> For credit derivatives that reference multiple names, the structure of the contract will determine the long and short positions that are created for capital purposes.  In addition, the type of product used will also have a bearing on the positions created.  In general, the number of exposures in a basket transaction should be limited to a reasonable number to continue to be treated as a credit derivative.  If the number of exposures is deemed to be significant then the transaction may be treated as a synthetic securitization and therefore subject to additional rules.</p>\r\n<p>For a total rate of return swap that references multiple names, the institution should record long or short positions in all the reference assets according to their relative proportions underlying the swap. This approach applies where the returns on the assets are exchanged between the swap counterparties according to the asset proportions in the basket.  If this is not the case, the long and short positions should be altered to reflect the asset returns.</p>\r\n<p>The beneficiary in a basket transaction that is structured as a &quot;first-to-default&quot; product must record a short position in one reference asset in the basket.  Institutions may choose the specific asset in the basket to be used for this purpose, provided it is an asset carrying the highest risk weighting or one that reflects the greatest risk.</p>\r\n<p>The guarantor in a basket transaction that is structured as a &quot;first-to-default&quot; product must record long positions in each asset in the basket.  This is because there is no knowledge as to which asset could default.  The total capital charge for this type of product will be capped at the equivalent of a deduction from capital for the entire notional amount.</p>\r\n<p>Where a basket transaction or multiple name note is rated so that it meets the conditions for recognition as a &quot;qualifying&quot; debt instrument under Part II of this Guideline, the guarantor may record the specific risk position in the reference assets as a single long specific risk position with the specific risk of the note issuer.</p>\r\n<h6>Netting </h6>\r\n<p>Netting of positions within the specific risk category is permitted under the conditions described for offsetting and matched positions (see Annex 3).  Where a credit default product or credit- linked note is of shorter maturity than the reference asset, a specific risk offset is allowed between the long and short specific risk positions, but a forward position in the specific risk of the reference asset is recorded.  The net result is a single specific risk charge for the longer maturity position in the reference asset.</p>\r\n<h6>General Market Risk</h6>\r\n<p> General market risk for credit derivatives is calculated using the same methodology as that used for cash market debt instruments.  As a result, the combinations for general market risk charges are more limited than those combinations relating to specific risk.  Refer to Part II of this Guideline to determine the capital allocation of general market risk rules.</p>\r\n<p>Most credit default products do not create a general market risk position for either the guarantor or the beneficiary, since they are written against one counterparty\'s potential default.  There is no risk exposure to market movements.</p>\r\n<p>Total rate of return products create a long or short position in the reference asset as well as a short or long position in the notional bond representing the interest rate related leg of the contract.  These positions should be incorporated into a maturity ladder using standardized risk weights that approximate the price sensitivity of the instruments.</p>\r\n<p>Credit-linked note products create a long position in the note itself but the position is only applied to the guarantor.</p>\r\n<h5>Models Approach</h5>\r\n<p> Questions on the use of models for credit derivatives should be directed to an institution\'s Relationship Manager.</p>\r\n<h4 id="ToCERiskManagement">E.  Risk Management</h4>\r\n<p>Sound risk management practices are essential for an institution engaging in credit derivatives. Factors to consider for institutions engaging in credit derivative activities are the same as those for other derivative products and are outlined in OSFI Guideline B-7 - Derivatives Best Practices.</p>\r\n<p>Credit derivatives offer institutions the potential to improve the risk/return profile of their credit portfolios through risk diversification; however, these products are largely untested and are generally illiquid.  Similarly, valuation methods for credit derivative transactions are not as well developed as they are for other derivatives.  In light of these uncertainties, institutions interested in using credit derivatives should exercise proper care and due diligence before participating.  In particular, credit derivatives should be subject to a rigorous process for new product approval to ensure that adequate policies, procedures, controls and resources exist to undertake this activity.</p>\r\n<p>Credit derivatives entail risks similar to those inherent in traditional banking products.  However, credit derivatives may introduce risks in unfamiliar combinations, thereby posing unique challenges to the way the risks are measured, monitored, and controlled.  When OSFI reviews credit derivatives, they will assess how institutions have evaluated the amount of credit, market, liquidity, operational, legal and regulatory risks involved in this activity.  In addition, OSFI will evaluate the quality of the risk mitigants to manage and control these risks.  These would include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>     effective board and senior management oversight, which includes the approval of strategy and the setting of limits;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>     adequate risk management processes to identify, measure, monitor, control and report on exposure relative to the limits; and</p></li>\r\n<li><p>     adequate internal controls and appropriate internal audit coverage.</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 id="ToCAnnex1Background">Annex 1 - Background</h3>\r\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cCredit derivative\xe2\x80\x9d is a term generally used to describe various financial instruments that are marketed as an efficient way to manage credit exposure.  Credit derivatives are designed to assume or mitigate the credit risk of loans and other assets through off-balance sheet transactions. Institutions may employ these products either as end-users, purchasing credit protection or acquiring credit exposure from third parties, or as dealers intermediating these activities.  End-user institutions may use credit derivatives to reduce credit concentrations, improve portfolio diversification, or otherwise manage overall credit risk exposure.</p>\r\n<p>Credit derivatives permit the transfer of credit exposure between counterparties in isolation from other risks.  This is an extension of similar products that un-bundle risks, such as various interest rate contracts and foreign exchange products.   Credit derivatives are primarily off-balance sheet contracts, as opposed to traditional loan type assets that are on-balance sheet.</p>\r\n<p>Given that credit derivatives are relatively new products and banks are able to participate in a number of different roles, the terms used to define the participant\'s functions are evolving with the market place.  For example, the guarantor is also referred to as the protection seller or credit risk buyer.  On the other hand, the beneficiary is also referred to as the protection buyer or credit risk seller.  These terms are often used interchangeably within the market place.</p>\r\n<p>There are many reasons why a bank may use credit derivatives.  Some of those include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>     reducing the capital required to support assets on the balance sheet;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>     reducing credit risk concentrations by assuming a risk position in a market that it may otherwise not have access to;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>     improving earnings by assuming credit risk in a specifically targeted risk;</p></li>\r\n<li><p>     managing credit risk at the account level while not negatively affecting the customer relationship; and</p></li>\r\n<li><p>     creating new assets and synthetic assets to meet wider investor demand and/or filling maturity and credit quality gaps.</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 id="ToCAnnex2ProductTypes">Annex 2 - Product Types</h3>\r\n<h4>Description of Credit Derivatives</h4>\r\n<p> The most widely used types of credit derivatives are credit default products and total rate-of- return (TROR) swaps.  While the timing and structure of the cash flows associated with credit default and TROR swaps differ, the economic substance of both arrangements seek to transfer the credit risk of the asset(s) referenced in the transaction.</p>\r\n<p>Another less common form of credit derivative is the credit-linked note, which is an obligation that is based on a reference asset.  Credit-linked notes are similar to structured notes with embedded credit derivatives.  Credit indicators on the reference asset rather than market price factors influence the payment of interest and principal.  If there is a credit event, the repayment of the note\'s principal is based on the price of the reference asset.</p>\r\n<h5>Total Rate-of-Return Swap</h5>\r\n<p> In a total rate-of-return (TROR) swap, illustrated below, the beneficiary (Bank A) agrees to pay the guarantor (Bank B) the total return on the reference asset, which consists of all contractual payments, as well as any appreciation in the market value of the reference asset.  To complete the swap arrangement, the guarantor agrees to pay LIBOR plus a spread and any depreciation to the beneficiary.  The guarantor in a TROR swap could be viewed as having synthetic ownership of the reference asset since it bears the risks and rewards of ownership over the term of the swap.</p>\r\n<div class="align-center">\r\n<img alt="Not yet defined" src="/Eng/PublishingImages/A3graph1.png" />\r\n\xc2\xa0</div>\r\n<p>At each payment exchange date (including when the swap matures) -- or upon default, at which point the swap may terminate -- any depreciation or appreciation in the amortized value of the reference asset is calculated as the difference between the notional principal balance of the reference asset and the &quot;dealer price.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>The dealer price is generally determined either by referring to a market quotation source or by polling a group of dealers and reflects changes in the credit profile of the reference obligor and reference asset.</p>\r\n<p>If the dealer price is less than the notional amount (i.e., the hypothetical original price of the reference asset) of the contract, then the guarantor must pay the difference to the beneficiary, absorbing any loss caused by a decline in the credit quality of the reference asset.  Thus, a TROR swap differs from a standard direct credit substitute in that the guarantor is guaranteeing not only against default of the reference obligor, but also against a deterioration in that obligor\'s credit quality, which can occur even if there is no default.</p>\r\n<h5>Credit Default Swaps/Products</h5>\r\n<p> The purpose of a credit default swap, as its name suggests, is to provide protection against credit losses associated with a default on a specified reference asset.  The swap purchaser (beneficiary) swaps the credit risk with the provider of the swap (guarantor).  While the transaction is called a swap, it is very similar to a guarantee.</p>\r\n<div class="align-center">\r\n<img alt="Not yet defined" src="/Eng/PublishingImages/A3graph2.png" />\r\n\xc2\xa0</div>\r\n<p>In a credit default swap, the beneficiary (Bank A) agrees to pay to the guarantor (Bank B) a fee typically amounting to a certain number of basis points on the par value of the reference asset, either quarterly or annually.  In return, the guarantor agrees to pay the beneficiary an agreed upon, market-based, post-default amount or a predetermined fixed percentage of the value of the reference asset if there is a default.  The guarantor makes no payment until there is a default.  A default is strictly defined in the contract to include, for example, bankruptcy, insolvency, or payment default, and the default event must be publicly verifiable.  In some instances, the guarantor need not make payments to the beneficiary until a pre-established amount of loss has been exceeded in conjunction with a default event.  This event is often referred to as the maturity of the swap.  The amount owed by the guarantor is the difference between the reference asset\'s initial principal (or notional) amount and the actual market value of the defaulted, reference asset. The method for establishing the post-default market value of the reference asset should be set out in the contract.  Often, the market value of the defaulted reference asset may be determined by sampling dealer quotes.  The guarantor may have the option to purchase the defaulted underlying asset and pursue a workout with the borrower directly.  Alternatively, the swap may call for a fixed payment in the event of default, for example, 15 per cent of the notional value of the reference asset.  The treatment of credit default swaps could differ from a guarantee depending upon the definition of default, the term, and the extent of coverage.</p>\r\n<h5>Credit-Linked Notes</h5>\r\n<p> In a credit-linked note, the beneficiary (Bank A) agrees to pay the guarantor (Bank B) the interest on an issued note referenced to a bond.  The guarantor has in this case paid the principal on the note to the issuing bank.  If there is no default on the reference bond, the note simply matures at the end of the period.  If a credit event occurs on the bond, the note is redeemed, based on the default recovery.</p>\r\n<div class="align-center">\r\n<img alt="Not yet defined" src="/Eng/PublishingImages/A3graph3.png" />\r\n\xc2\xa0</div>\r\n<p>A credit-linked note is a securitized version of a credit default swap.  The difference between a credit default swap and a credit-linked note is that the beneficiary bank receives the principal payment from the guarantor when the contract is originated.</p>\r\n<p>Through the purchase of the credit-linked note, the guarantor (Bank B) assumes the risk of the bond and funds this exposure through the purchase of the note.  The guarantor bank takes on the exposure to the beneficiary (Bank A) to the full amount of the funding it has provided.  The beneficiary bank hedges its risk on the bond without acquiring any additional credit exposure. Many variations of this product are available.</p>\r\n<h5>Credit Spread Products</h5>\r\n<p> Credit derivative products can also go beyond the credit transfer products described above to include various forms of credit spread products or index related products.  These types of instruments tend not to be credit risk management vehicles but rather options that are traded on the credit quality or credit migration of the underlying assets.  In these cases, the bank is not transferring or hedging its risk but rather attempting to profit from changes in spreads.  These products should be treated identically to other option products under Part II of this Guideline.</p>\r\n<h3 id="ToCAnnex3NettingofTradingBookPositions">Annex 3 - Netting of Trading Book Positions</h3>\r\n<p>There are three types of positions in credit derivatives against which banks hold risk-based capital for each of the three risk areas (specific risk, general market risk and counterparty credit risk).  These three positions are: 1) matched positions; 2) offsetting positions; and 3) open positions.  Matched positions encompass long and short positions in identical credit derivative structures over identical maturities referencing identical assets.  Matching also requires that default definitions include the same credit events, materiality thresholds, and other relevant contract terms.  Offsetting positions encompass long and short credit derivative positions in reference assets of the same obligor with the same level of seniority in bankruptcy.  Offsetting positions include positions that would otherwise be matched except that the long and short credit derivative positions have different maturities or one leg is a total return swap and the other is a default product.  Open positions are those that do not qualify as matched or offsetting positions.</p>\r\n<h4>Credit Derivatives - Market Risk Capital Framework</h4>\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody><tr>\r\n<td></td>\r\n<th>Counterparty\r\nCredit Risk</th>\r\n<th>General\r\nMarket Risk</th>\r\n<th>Specific\r\nRisk</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>Open Position</th>\r\n<td>Yes</td>\r\n<td>Yes</td>\r\n<td>Yes</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>Matched Position</th>\r\n<td>Yes</td>\r\n<td>No</td>\r\n<td>No</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>Offsetting Position</th>\r\n<td>Yes</td>\r\n<td>Yes (Reduced)</td>\r\n<td>Yes (Reduced)</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody></table>\r\n<p>From the table above, it is clear that all credit derivative positions have counterparty risk.
