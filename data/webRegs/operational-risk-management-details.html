The operational risk appetite statement should be succinct, clear, and include a measurable component (limits/thresholds). The purpose of having a measurable component is to indicate the level of operational risk that is considered acceptable within the FRFI. The limits/thresholds may also serve to indicate the level at which operational risk events, near misses, or cumulative patterns, are considered necessary for escalation to Senior Management (in some cases, separate reporting thresholds may be established).</li>

Operational risk management frameworks are designed to permit the collection of information in specific areas across business lines on an enterprise wide basis. This can be particularly useful in areas such as external fraud across product lines, legal losses across the organisation, or system breaches/inadequacies (whether indicative of isolated instances of rogue behaviour or wider systemic problems). <span class= "remove">In larger organisations with well-established second lines of defence, the information collection and aggregation capabilities of these professional groups can lead to better problem identification and thus more comprehensive and longer-term solutions to corporate-wide organisational issues.</span></li>

Further, the size and degree of independence of the second line of defence will differ among FRFIs. For example, for small FRFIs with low operational risk exposures, objective overview may be achieved through separation of duties. In larger FRFIs, however, the second line of defence will generally consist of a separate function most often reporting into the risk management function.</span><span class="remove"> The second line of defence should have an appropriate level of sufficiently skilled resources and stature to effectively fulfill its responsibilities.</span></li>
