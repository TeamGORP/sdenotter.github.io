Principles</h2>\r\n<div class="module-note module-simplify span-6">\r\n  <p><strong><em>Principle 1: Residential  Mortgage Insurance Underwriting Plan</em></strong></p>\r\n  <p><em>A FRMI that is engaged in residential mortgage insurance underwriting  should have a comprehensive Residential Mortgage Insurance Underwriting Plan (RMIUP).  The FRMI\xe2\x80\x99s insurance underwriting practices  and procedures should comply with its established RMIUP. </em></p>\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>Residential Mortgage Insurance Underwriting Plan (RMIUP)</h3>\r\n<p>The RMIUP is a  document (or set of documents) that consolidates the FRMI\xe2\x80\x99s key mortgage  insurance underwriting policies. It includes a description of a FRMI\xe2\x80\x99s business  objectives, risk appetite, and risk management policies.  The RMIUP also contains other key elements  that relate to, or support, mortgage insurance underwriting. </p>\r\n<p>The RMIUP  should include the insurer\xe2\x80\x99s complete set of mortgage insurance products (and  baseline underwriting criteria for each product<sup id="fnb5-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb5"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>5</a></sup>),  the requirements and conditions for lenders for mortgage insurance coverage<sup id="fnb6-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb6"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>6</a></sup>,  and policies for assessing lenders\xe2\x80\x99 underwriting and compliance with its  mortgage insurance agreements<sup id="fnb7-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb7"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>7</a></sup>.</p>\r\n<p>The RMIUP should describe the FRMI\xe2\x80\x99s delegated authorities  for approving mortgage insurance applications, including its approach for  approving any exceptions to the baseline underwriting criteria. Additionally,  the RMIUP should outline the FRMI\xe2\x80\x99s policies for detecting and addressing fraud. </p>\r\n<h3>Roles of the Board and Senior Management \xe2\x80\x93 Development and Oversight of RMIUP</h3>\r\n<p>Senior Management should be responsible for the development and implementation of the RMIUP. However, the Board of the FRMI has a critical role in providing guidance to, and oversight of, Senior Management on matters pertaining to mortgage insurance underwriting.</p>\r\n<div class="module-attention module-simplify span-6">\r\n  <p><em>The FRMI\xe2\x80\x99s Board should review and discuss the RMIUP or any changes  to the RMIUP at least annually, or more frequently as circumstances require.  The Board should understand the decisions,  plans, and policies being undertaken by Senior Management with respect to  residential mortgage insurance underwriting, and their potential impact on the FRMI.  The Board should probe and seek assurances  from Senior Management that these are consistent with the Board\xe2\x80\x99s own decisions  and Board-approved business and risk strategy for the FRMI, and that the FRMI\xe2\x80\x99s  internal controls are sound and being implemented in an effective manner.</em></p>\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>Internal Controls, Monitoring and Reporting</h3>\r\n<p>Effective controls, monitoring and reporting systems and  procedures should be developed and maintained by FRMIs to ensure ongoing  operational compliance with the RMIUP. This includes processes for monitoring  and testing compliance with established mortgage insurance underwriting policies  by the FRMI\xe2\x80\x99s staff, mortgage lenders, and third parties (e.g., property appraisers). </p>\r\n<p>A FRMI should identify,  measure, monitor, and report to the Senior Management and the Board on all  relevant risks (e.g., strategic, operational, and financial, including credit,  market, and liquidity risks) in its residential mortgage insurance operations,  on an ongoing basis.  To support  operational compliance, the FRMI\xe2\x80\x99s residential mortgage insurance risk appetite,  risk limit profile, and risk management policies should be understood at all  relevant levels of the FRMI. </p>\r\n<p>A FRMI should have  adequate processes in place with respect to residential mortgage insurance to  independently and objectively:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li class="margin-bottom-small">Identify, assess and analyze key risks and monitor  risk exposures against the FRMI\xe2\x80\x99s Board-approved risk appetite;</li>\r\n  <li class="margin-bottom-small">Ensure that risks are appropriately controlled  and mitigated, and provide assurances to the Board and Senior Management; </li>\r\n  <li class="margin-bottom-small">Ensure that risk management policies, processes  and limits are being adhered to, and provide assurances to the Board and Senior  Management; </li>\r\n  <li class="margin-bottom-small">Provide the Board and Senior Management with regular  reporting that covers: </li>\r\n  <li class="indent-large">Insurance underwriting exceptions, including the  identification of any patterns, trends or systemic issues within the  residential mortgage insurance portfolio that may impair insurance quality or  risk mitigation factors;</li>\r\n  <li class="indent-large">Quality assurance processes in relation to  lenders\xe2\x80\x99 practices and compliance with the FRMI\xe2\x80\x99s mortgage insurance criteria  and mortgage insurance coverage requirements;</li>\r\n  <li class="indent-large">Claims settlement and claims exceptions, as well  as operational preparedness for increased claims under stress events; and </li>\r\n  <li class="indent-large">Effectiveness  of underwriting systems and key underwriting-related models (e.g., property  valuation).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Mortgage Insurance Underwriting Declaration </h3>\r\n<p>A senior officer of a FRMI should  make an annual declaration to the Board confirming that the FRMI\xe2\x80\x99s residential mortgage  insurance underwriting and associated risk management practices and procedures  meet, except as otherwise disclosed in the declaration, the principles set out  in this Guideline. </p>\r\n<p>Where deviations  from the Guideline occur, the nature and extent of the deviations, and the  measures taken or proposed to correct and mitigate the risk associated with the  deviations, should be fully documented and disclosed to the Board and OSFI.</p>\r\n<div class="module-note module-simplify span-6">\r\n  <p><strong><em>Principle 2: Establishing  Standards for the Initial Assessment and Qualification of Mortgage Lenders</em></strong></p>\r\n  <p><em>A FRMI should establish sound standards for the purpose of initially  assessing and qualifying mortgage lenders for mortgage insurance coverage. </em></p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>A FRMI should ensure that a lender applying for mortgage insurance coverage is adequately qualified to offer and service mortgage loans and that it has adequate processes in place to comply with the FRMI\xe2\x80\x99s mortgage insurance coverage requirements, before providing mortgage insurance coverage to that lender. </p>\r\n<p>To carry out an  initial assessment of a mortgage lender, a FRMI should establish sound qualification  standards. Factors that should be considered include, but are not limited to:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li class="margin-bottom-small">Financial soundness of  the lender;</li>\r\n  <li class="margin-bottom-small">Mortgage loan  underwriting experience, practices and procedures; </li>\r\n  <li class="margin-bottom-small">Ability of the lender to provide timely and accurate information on the performance  of its mortgage loans; and  </li>\r\n  <li class="margin-bottom-small">Delinquency, foreclosure and, where applicable, claims management  processes. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Lenders  should meet the FRMI\xe2\x80\x99s established standards on an ongoing basis. The nature of  the assessment and designation should reflect the lender\xe2\x80\x99s regulatory status,<sup id="fnb8-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb8"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>8</a></sup> current or proposed business model and the specific approvals being sought by  the lender. The FRMI\xe2\x80\x99s standards for qualifying and designating lenders should  be consistent with any applicable federal laws and regulations (e.g., PRHMIA and  its associated Regulations).</p>\r\n\r\n<div class="module-note module-simplify span-6">\r\n  <p><strong><em>Principle 3: Mortgage  Insurance Criteria and Insurance Coverage Requirements for Lenders </em></strong></p>\r\n  <p><em>A FRMI should establish prudent underwriting criteria, which  specify the characteristics and parameters of insurable mortgage loans for  lenders. In addition, for the purpose of controlling risk, a FRMI should promote  sound mortgage underwriting and loan management practices by mortgage lenders  by establishing prudent requirements in its insurance policies (e.g., Master  Policy Agreements). </em></p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Important factors that influence the overall risk borne by a FRMI from its mortgage insurance business include, among others, the underlying risk of the mortgage loans it has insured, as well as the effectiveness of lenders\xe2\x80\x99 mortgage underwriting practices and management of those loans. </p>\r\n<p>To help manage credit risk and to promote prudent mortgage underwriting,  proper loan management, and timely reporting of relevant information by lenders,  a FRMI should outline the specific characteristics and parameters that define the  types of mortgage loans the FRMI is normally willing to insure (i.e., \xe2\x80\x9ccriteria  for mortgage loans\xe2\x80\x9d). A FRMI should also establish requirements for lenders (usually  contained in a Master Policy Agreement), as a condition for initial and continuing  mortgage insurance coverage.</p>\r\n<h3>Criteria for Mortgage Loans </h3>\r\n<p>A FRMI\xe2\x80\x99s <em>criteria for mortgage loans</em><sup id="fnb9-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb9"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>9</a></sup> outline the baseline characteristics and parameter values (e.g., specific debt  service coverage ratios, credit scores, etc.) for mortgage loans that the  mortgage insurer will normally insure. These criteria are central to the FRMI\xe2\x80\x99s  underwriting process and should be sound and prudently set and consistent with  the objectives and risk appetite established by the FRMI in its RMIUP<sup id="fnb10-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb10"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>10</a></sup>. While a FRMI is  expected to outline its insurance underwriting criteria for lenders, and  lenders typically carry out the mortgage loan underwriting function, the FRMI  is expected to retain responsibility for approving or denying mortgage  insurance for loans.</p>\r\n<p>At minimum, the  criteria for mortgage loans should cover the following components, for each mortgage  insurance product and insurance type (i.e., transactional or portfolio  insurance).</p>\r\n<h4>(i) Mortgage Loan  Parameters:</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li class="margin-bottom-small">Allowable loan purpose;</li>\r\n  <li class="margin-bottom-small">Allowable loan  security position;</li>\r\n  <li class="margin-bottom-small">Maximum mortgage loan  size and, if applicable, maximum exposure to any one borrower and/or related  parties;</li>\r\n  <li class="margin-bottom-small">Maximum loan-to-value  (\xe2\x80\x9cLTV\xe2\x80\x9d) ratio; and</li>\r\n  <li class="margin-bottom-small">Maximum allowable loan  term and amortization length.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>(ii) Borrower\xe2\x80\x99s Background  and Willingness and Capacity to Service Debt:</h4>\r\n<p>As  part of the insurance underwriting process, a FRMI should ensure that lenders have  a process for undertaking a reasonable inquiry into a borrower\xe2\x80\x99s background and  demonstrated willingness and capacity to service debt. As part of its criteria  for mortgage loans, a FRMI should establish and outline prudent underwriting criteria  for the assessment of the borrower, which should include, but is not limited to:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n  <li class="margin-bottom-medium"><strong>Background and Credit  History</strong>: A FRMI should outline  acceptable  methods for lenders to  assess the financial background of prospective borrowers, including the use of credit  history checks and credit bureau reports. The mortgage loan criteria should outline  the FRMI\xe2\x80\x99s minimum credit bureau score requirements.</li>\r\n  <li class="margin-bottom-medium"><strong>Down Payment</strong>:  A FRMI should establish minimum down payments, as well as acceptable sources of  down payment in its criteria. In particular, the FRMI should specify where  traditional sources of down payment (e.g., borrower\xe2\x80\x99s own equity) are required  and cases where non-traditional sources for the down payment (e.g., borrowed  funds) may be used. Where non-traditional sources of down payment are being  used, further consideration should be given to establishing greater risk  mitigation and/or additional premiums to compensate for increased risk.  Incentive and rebate payments (i.e., \xe2\x80\x9ccash back\xe2\x80\x9d) should not be considered part  of the down payment<sup id="fnb11-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb11"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>11</a></sup>.</li>\r\n  <li class="margin-bottom-medium"><strong>Income and Employment  Verification</strong>: A FRMI should specify for lenders, processes  for verifying a borrower\xe2\x80\x99s underlying income and sources of income. This  includes substantiation of employment status and the income history of the  borrower. For borrowers who are self-employed, a FRMI should outline reasonable  steps for lenders to obtain income verification (e.g., Notice of Assessment)  and relevant business documentation. In determining the  reasonableness of the documentation used to support the income, sound practice  suggests that:\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>The  income amount is verified by an independent source;</li>\r\n    <li>The  verification source is difficult to falsify;</li>\r\n    <li>The  verification source directly addresses the amount of the declared income; and</li>\r\n    <li>The  income verification information and documentation does not contradict other  information provided by the borrower in the underwriting process.</li>\r\n  </ul></li>\r\n  <li class="margin-bottom-medium"><strong>Debt Service Coverage</strong>:  A FRMI should outline quantitative limits on debt service coverage ratios,  using measures such as the total debt service (TDS) and gross debt service  (GDS) ratios, as a means to assess affordability. In general, debt service coverage  ratios should be calculated conservatively. To reduce ambiguity, a FRMI should have  clear policies with respect to the contributing factors for the calculation of  debt service coverage ratios.<sup id="fnb12-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb12"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>12</a></sup> A FRMI should clearly outline the formulae to be used by lenders to calculate  debt service coverage and describe how key inputs (e.g., income, mortgage loan  interest and principal repayment, other debt obligations, etc.) should be  treated. This includes specifying any \xe2\x80\x9cqualification\xe2\x80\x9d parameters that should be  used in calculating debt serviceability (e.g., interest rates) for the purpose  of reducing risk.<sup id="fnb13-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb13"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>13</a></sup></li>\r\n    <li class="margin-bottom-medium"><strong>Loan Recourse  and Additional Assessment Criteria</strong>:  A FRMI\xe2\x80\x99s decision  to insure a mortgage loan (or require higher risk mitigation) should consider  the effectiveness of recourse against the borrower in the event of borrower  default. To  the extent possible, a  FRMI should also consider  factors  that would not ordinarily be captured by income and debt  serviceability metrics, such as the borrower\xe2\x80\x99s  assets (e.g., savings). </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>(iii) Underlying Mortgage Property:</h4>\r\n<p>Conducting  a thorough assessment of the underlying property, prior to insurance approval, helps  to reduce risk in the residential mortgage insurance business. As part of the FRMI\xe2\x80\x99s  criteria for mortgage loans, a FRMI should outline clear and transparent  policies in respect of the property acting as collateral, including:  </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li class="margin-bottom-medium"><strong>Insurable Property  Types</strong>: Insurable and non-insurable property  types, dwelling types, and tenure.</li>\r\n  <li class="margin-bottom-medium"><strong>Responsibility for Property  Valuation</strong>: A FRMI should retain  responsibility for carrying out property valuation for transactional mortgage  insurance. In the case of portfolio insurance (where insurance is applied to a pool  of uninsured mortgage loans), a FRMI should conduct its own updated property  valuation for the underlying mortgage loans, using a risk-based approach. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 </li>\r\n  <li class="margin-bottom-medium"><strong>Property Valuation  Assessment</strong>: In assessing the value of a property  (or requiring a third party to carry out the assessment<sup id="fnb14-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb14"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>14</a></sup>), a FRMI should take a  risk-based approach, and consider a combination of valuation tools and  appraisal processes appropriate to the underlying risk being undertaken (e.g.,  automated valuation model, review of comparable properties, on-site  inspections, drive-by appraisals, progress inspection  reports, and/or a full appraisal). In general, a FRMI  should not rely exclusively on any single method for property valuation. A FRMI  should undertake a more comprehensive and prudent approach to collateral  valuation for applications with higher overall risk (e.g., less liquid  properties, higher risk borrowers).</li>\r\n  <li class="margin-bottom-medium"><strong>General Property  Requirements</strong>: A description of any additional  property requirements or restrictions on use of the property. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>(iv) Mortgage Insurance Premiums: </h4>\r\n<p>A FRMI should establish actuarially-sound premium  rates for the risks it incurs, taking into consideration the overall risk of  insuring  mortgage loans and the potential that economic and market  conditions and/or borrower characteristics can unexpectedly change. A FRMI  should review its mortgage insurance premiums periodically, but at least annually.        </p>\r\n<h3>Insurance Coverage \xe2\x80\x93 Conditions and Requirements for Lenders</h3>\r\n<p>To promote  prudent mortgage loan underwriting and loan management consistent with the FRMI\xe2\x80\x99s  interests and to help control risk, a FRMI should outline (e.g., in a Master  Policy Agreement or other insurance policy documents) requirements, conditions,  and any other obligations to be adhered to, or carried out, by lenders for  initial and continuing mortgage insurance coverage.  The elements covered should include, but are  not limited to, the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li class="margin-bottom-medium"><strong>Description of Mortgage  Insurance Coverage</strong>: A FRMI should provide a description  of the mortgage insurance coverage (and any relevant coverage exclusions), as well as the events  and conditions for the calculation and payment of claims.</li>\r\n  <li class="margin-bottom-medium"><strong>Complete, Accurate and  Timely Information</strong>: As a condition for mortgage  insurance coverage, a FRMI should require that lenders provide complete,  accurate, and timely information when submitting applications for mortgage loan  insurance and throughout the life of an insured mortgage loan.</li>\r\n  <li class="margin-bottom-medium"><strong>Documentation  Retention</strong>: A FRMI should establish requirements  for lenders to exercise sound loan documentation practices as a condition of  mortgage insurance coverage. This includes lenders maintaining complete  documentation of information obtained in the underwriting of a mortgage loan. For  insured mortgage loans, relevant documentation should be maintained by the  lender for the length of time that insurance coverage is in place. For greater  clarity, a FRMI should specify the types of information required to be documented  and retained by lenders for newly insured mortgage loans, cases where a borrower  switches lenders and for insured mortgage loans that are transferred to another  borrower or property. </li>\r\n  <li class="margin-bottom-medium"><strong>Access to Information</strong>:  Rights conferred on the lender to share information with the FRMI so that the  FRMI may access underwriting information and conduct due diligence in respect  of a prospective or insured mortgage loan or borrower.  A FRMI should ensure that it obtains  appropriate borrower consent to access both the borrower\xe2\x80\x99s information as well  as the lender\xe2\x80\x99s underwriting documentation involving borrower information. A FRMI should also ensure it complies with relevant laws  governing the use and privacy of personal information (e.g., see the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-8.6/index.html" rel="external"><em>Personal Information  Protection and Electronic Documents Act</em></a>).</li>\r\n  <li class="margin-bottom-medium"><strong>Updated Information</strong>: A FRMI should establish requirements and  standards for lenders to provide the insurer with accurate, timely and updated  information on insured mortgage loans. This includes reporting of relevant  credit risk information (e.g., outstanding loan balances, level of arrears)  around \xe2\x80\x9cevents,\xe2\x80\x9d such as insured mortgage loan delinquencies and defaults.  Updated information should also be provided for any specified loan  modification, restructuring or transfer of an insured mortgage loan to an  alternate borrower, property or lender. To allow for a current assessment of its  overall mortgage insurance exposures, a FRMI should obtain an updated  outstanding mortgage loan balance for each insured mortgage loan, on a periodic  basis, but at least quarterly. The updated loan information obtained from  lenders should be sufficient in detail to facilitate the FRMI\xe2\x80\x99s reconciliation  to its own records.  <strong></strong></li>\r\n  <li class="margin-bottom-medium"><strong>Property Valuation</strong>:  Rights conferred on the FRMI, by the borrower, and through the lender\xe2\x80\x99s  documentation, to permit and allow use of specific methods of property and land  valuation (e.g., appraisals), as needed, on a case-by-case basis. </li>\r\n  <li class="margin-bottom-medium"><strong>Property Condition</strong>:  To the extent that a FRMI may need to realize on the underlying property  serving as security, it is important to have put in place sound collateral  practices and procedures, at the point of origination, which cover the property  throughout the life of the insurance policy. For the purposes of controlling  insurance risk, a FRMI should establish requirements for lenders for managing distressed  properties.  A FRMI should clearly  outline the responsibility for arranging appropriate insurance coverage against  physical damage, as well as the responsibility for costs related to any  uninsured physical damage to properties (i.e., property damage beyond normal  wear and tear) when settling claims on defaulted loans.      </li>\r\n  <li class="margin-bottom-medium"><strong>Lenders\xe2\x80\x99 Management of  Delinquent and Defaulted Loans</strong>: A FRMI should  establish standards for lenders\xe2\x80\x99 management of delinquent and defaulted loans  that reasonably mitigate the frequency and severity of claims to the insurer.  This includes outlining options for loan workouts and permissible claims  settlement methods (e.g., deficiency basis or \xe2\x80\x9cproperty take-backs\xe2\x80\x9d), as  justified. A FRMI should also ensure  the inclusion of appropriate contractual terms and conditions that secure the FRMI\xe2\x80\x99s  full protection under the laws applicable in the relevant jurisdiction, and that  seek to preserve an appropriate variety of recourses (including, where  applicable, actions on personal covenant) should the borrower default. </li>\r\n  <li class="margin-bottom-medium"><strong>Conditions for the  Sale or Transfer of Mortgage Loans and/or Servicing Rights</strong>:  The sale or transfer of an insured mortgage loan or the servicing rights may  impact the overall risk borne by a FRMI. As a condition of insurance, a FRMI  should outline any requirements or obligations for lenders when seeking to transfer  or sell an insured mortgage loan, servicing rights, or both, including where  lenders require the FRMI\xe2\x80\x99s prior consent to carry out such transactions.     </li>\r\n  <li class="margin-bottom-medium"><strong>Conditions for  Mortgage Insurance Exceptions</strong>: A FRMI should  outline any conditions which must be satisfied in the case of exceptions to  criteria for insurable mortgage loans or for exceptions to requirements in any insurance  policy agreement. The FRMI should provide the lender with a record or policy  certificate validating the FRMI\xe2\x80\x99s approval to insure the mortgage loan, along  with any specific conditions that apply. The rationale and approval of  underwriting exceptions should be appropriately documented and maintained by  the FRMI. Such records help reduce the potential for disputes by providing  clear recognition where exceptions have been approved or conditions have been  attached to the insurance policies. </li>\r\n  <li class="margin-bottom-medium"><strong>Fraud Detection and  Reporting</strong>: Requirements for lenders to inform  FRMIs and report cases of suspected or verified fraud or misrepresentation in  respect of a mortgage insurance application or an insured mortgage loan.</li>\r\n  <li class="margin-bottom-medium"><strong>Termination of Insurance Policy</strong>: The conditions  or circumstances where policy coverage may be terminated or rescinded, or where  claims can be expected to be denied or reduced (e.g., misrepresentation or  fraud on the part of the lender, specific types of loan modifications by the  lender without the insurer\xe2\x80\x99s pre-approval, unrepaired physical damage to a  property, etc.). </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>To achieve clarity and certainty in respect of mortgage  insurance coverage, the insurance agreements between a FRMI and mortgage  lenders should be clear, comprehensive and unambiguous.  A FRMI should ensure that its insurance  policy coverage requirements, obligations, and any other terms and conditions  are binding and enforceable. Complete and final agreement of all components of  the mortgage insurance contract should be executed between a FRMI and a lender prior  to or upon the effective date of committing any mortgage insurance coverage. </p>\r\n<p>In general, a FRMI\xe2\x80\x99s maintenance of insurance coverage and payment  of claims should be made conditional on the lender satisfying all policy coverage  obligations and other requirements in the FRMI\xe2\x80\x99s insurance agreements. Any claims  exceptions should be defined in the FRMI\xe2\x80\x99s RMIUP, tracked, and reported to the  Senior Management and the Board. </p>\r\n<p>As part of a FRMI\xe2\x80\x99s sound practice, the FRMI should review  the requirements, conditions, and obligations established in its insurance coverage  agreements, at least annually, or more frequently as needed. Such reviews ensure  the agreements remain current and consistent with the decisions made by the FRMI\xe2\x80\x99s  Senior Management and the Board, as outlined in the FRMI\xe2\x80\x99s RMIUP.</p>\r\n<div class="module-note module-simplify span-6">\r\n  <p><strong><em>Principle 4: FRMI\xe2\x80\x99s  Periodic Assessments of Lenders\xe2\x80\x99 Underwriting Practices</em></strong></p>\r\n  <p><em>A FRMI should exercise reasonable due diligence regarding  lenders\xe2\x80\x99 underwriting practices, on a periodic basis, in order to assess consistency  with the FRMI\xe2\x80\x99s criteria for insuring mortgage loans and compliance with the requirements  contained in the FRMI\xe2\x80\x99s policy coverage documents. A FRMI should establish clear  policies for identifying, escalating, and as needed, addressing weak or  non-compliant lender practices.   </em></p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>As part of the mortgage insurance underwriting process, a FRMI typically obtains information from a lender\xe2\x80\x99s initial assessment of a prospective borrower. The overall prudence and rigour employed by a mortgage lender in the loan underwriting process is a factor that can influence the risk being transferred to the FRMI. </p>\r\n<p>Given that the  underlying motivations for funding a mortgage loan can differ from those for insuring  a mortgage loan, and that underwriting discipline among market participants can  change over time, it is important that a FRMI assess and verify the degree to  which its stated criteria and insurance policies are being followed by mortgage  lenders (or other servicing companies), as a means to measure, track, and  control risk.  Assessing lenders\xe2\x80\x99 practices  can also help to identify changing trends or emerging industry practices that  may require greater attention, remedial action, or changes to insurance  underwriting criteria.  </p>\r\n<p>OSFI expects  that a FRMI will undertake reasonable inquiries and reviews, on a risk-based  and periodic basis, into lenders\xe2\x80\x99 underwriting practices. This may include, but  is not limited to, reviews for assessing accuracy of insured mortgage loan  information in applications, reviews that are triggered and focused on  specific events (e.g., review of insurance claims), in-depth lender-specific assessments  (e.g., to assess a lender\xe2\x80\x99s underwriting and control functions), and/or  cross-sectional reviews of underwriting criteria across a group of lenders. </p>\r\n<p>In general, a FRMI\xe2\x80\x99s  assessment of an individual lender\xe2\x80\x99s practices, and the frequency of those  assessments, should be commensurate with the FRMI\xe2\x80\x99s level or concentration of risk  to that lender (i.e., a risk-based approach).   OSFI expects a FRMI to exercise a relatively higher level of examination  and scrutiny in respect of underperforming lenders (e.g., those with proportionately  higher levels of delinquencies and claims, on a risk-adjusted basis) or whose  practices have been found unsatisfactory or inconsistent with the insurer\xe2\x80\x99s  criteria or conditions established in the mortgage insurance policies (e.g.,  poor loan documentation, inconsistent reporting, evidence of misrepresentation,  forms of negligence, etc.).</p>\r\n<p>The review  process can include various methods, including automated reviews, desk-reviews,  as well as on-site inspections involving a team of reviewers.<sup id="fnb15-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb15"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>15</a></sup> In general, a FRMI should not rely on any one method or approach and should establish  clear policies for determining the types, methods, and frequency of reviews it  will undertake.<sup id="fnb16-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb16"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>16</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Lender reviews  should be undertaken by an independent function within or outside the FRMI  (either an internal or external group, or combination of both).<sup id="fnb17-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb17"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>17</a></sup> Reviewers should have the appropriate skills and expertise to conduct such  reviews and are expected to maintain adequate records and appropriate reporting  to Senior Management and the Board.  </p>\r\n<p>In general, the  results of such reviews should be considered in the insurance underwriting  decision-making process (i.e., part of the assessment of risk factors),  including to help a FRMI determine whether to insure various mortgage loans by  specific lenders or consider changes to underwriting standards. A FRMI  should have a policy for determining the relative weight placed on its lender  assessments and their contribution to the underwriting decision-making process. </p>\r\n<p>OSFI expects  that a FRMI will put in place clear policies to identify, escalate, and undertake  remedial action, as part of its review and quality assurance processes, to  address materially weak or inadequate underwriting practices or procedures by  lenders. In exceptional cases, where the FRMI identifies significant  inadequacies, the FRMI should consider appropriate responsive actions (e.g., depending  on the circumstances, corrective measures, applying more stringent underwriting  standards, or where remedial action is ineffective to effect change, declining  to insure mortgage loans by a specific lender, etc.). </p>\r\n<div class="module-note module-simplify span-6">\r\n  <p><strong><em>Principle 5: Assessment  and Validation of Underwriting Systems, Models, and Underwriters\xe2\x80\x99 Processes</em></strong></p>\r\n  <p><em>A FRMI that is engaged in residential mortgage insurance  underwriting should periodically assess and validate its insurance underwriting  systems, models, and underwriters\xe2\x80\x99 processes, to ensure sound insurance  underwriting outcomes and consistency with the FRMI\xe2\x80\x99s RMIUP.</em></p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Mortgage insurers often rely upon proprietary automated underwriting systems and other models to provide timely and comprehensive information for decision-making into the mortgage insurance underwriting process.  In the case of mortgage loans that do not meet standard underwriting characteristics or that are flagged for a closer review, mortgage insurers typically rely on individual underwriters to manually re-examine specific details of such loans before providing a recommendation as to whether to extend mortgage insurance. </p>\r\n<p>Ensuring that such systems, models, and underwriters\xe2\x80\x99  processes are robust and produce outcomes that are consistent with the objectives  and risk appetite outlined in a FRMI\xe2\x80\x99s RMIUP is central to sound mortgage  insurance underwriting and risk mitigation.  </p>\r\n<h3>Automated Underwriting Systems and Models </h3>\r\n<p>Automated underwriting systems and other models are commonly used to  help an insurer efficiently assess the risk of insuring a mortgage loan (or a  group of mortgage loans). Given the importance of underwriting systems and  other models to mortgage insurance underwriting, a FRMI should establish an  appropriate governance framework for models that outlines the standards and  criteria related to the adoption and use of models, data inputs, initial and  ongoing validation, and the treatment of model redevelopment and recalibration. </p>\r\n<p>As part of that framework, a FRMI should have an independent  validation process for models at initial implementation, and on a periodic  basis, to ensure ongoing performance and suitability. As needed, mortgage  insurers should recalibrate associated parameters with respect to their models,  based on findings of file reviews (e.g., performance of comparable tools for  property assessments).</p>\r\n<p>For automated underwriting systems, a FRMI should put in  place programs to continuously monitor and audit the information received on  mortgage loans to reduce the potential for inaccuracies and to help detect fraud  or \xe2\x80\x9cgaming.\xe2\x80\x9d This includes the use of back-testing processes.  A FRMI should take immediate remedial action  to address identified weaknesses in its automated underwriting systems.  </p>\r\n<h3>Mortgage Insurance Underwriters\xe2\x80\x99 Processes</h3>\r\n<p>Mortgage insurers often depend on underwriters to assess the  risks underlying mortgage loans that generally do not meet standard  underwriting characteristics or which are otherwise flagged by automated systems.  Underwriters are normally required to assess the degree to which such loans are  deficient in meeting baseline characteristics and judge the value of  compensating factors (e.g., risk mitigating factors, such as a borrower\xe2\x80\x99s assets),  prior to approving a mortgage loan for insurance. </p>\r\n<p>A FRMI should ensure that its underwriting personnel have  the appropriate skills, experience and training to carry out their function.  To support consistency of outcomes with a FRMI\xe2\x80\x99s  RMIUP, a FRMI should document and maintain standard operating procedures for  all personnel involved in the underwriting of mortgage insurance. Underwriters\xe2\x80\x99  decisions should be well-documented and sufficient to facilitate third-party  replication of the approval decision. A specific underwriting authority and escalation  process should be established and applied according to the level of  underwriting risk, as well as for review and approval of policy exceptions.</p>\r\n<p>A FRMI should have in place processes, conducted by an  independent oversight function, for regularly monitoring and evaluating the  overall quality of underwriters\xe2\x80\x99 practices and for assessing the performance of  individual underwriters and compliance with established procedures.  This includes internal underwriting audits as  a means to assess compliance and consistency in decision-making.  </p>\r\n<div class="module-note module-simplify span-6">\r\n  <p><strong><em>Principle 6: Effective  Portfolio Risk Management and other Risk Mitigation</em></strong></p>\r\n  <p><em>FRMIs should have effective portfolio risk management  practices, including the use of stress testing and, as appropriate, the use of  reinsurance. Given the objectives and risk appetite established in the RMIUP, a  FRMI should consider the outcome of stress-testing and risk mitigation in appropriately  setting or adjusting its mortgage insurance underwriting criteria.    </em></p>\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>Portfolio Risk Management and Stress Testing</h3>\r\n<p>A mortgage  insurer commonly holds a portfolio of invested insurance premiums on the  asset-side of its balance sheet. It also holds insured mortgage loan  liabilities (i.e., the \xe2\x80\x9cinsurance in-force\xe2\x80\x9d portfolio).  Variability in the returns on its invested  assets, as well as uncertainty in the number and value of insurance claims pose  risk to a mortgage insurer in achieving its business objectives, and may  necessitate changes to underwriting criteria. </p>\r\n<p>To support an  assessment of risk, a FRMI should have in place a stress-testing regime that  considers \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional, but plausible\xe2\x80\x9d events and scenarios and their impact on  the asset- and liability-side portfolios.<sup id="fnb18-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb18"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>18</a></sup>  Based on the assessment of risk, OSFI expects  that a FRMI will consider appropriate adjustments to its mortgage insurance  underwriting criteria (e.g., re-calibrating its criteria for mortgage loans)  and premium schedules, as necessary, to align the FRMI\xe2\x80\x99s underwriting  activities and overall portfolio risk, with the aim of achieving its  objectives, as outlined it its RMIUP.  Stress testing should  also be used to help inform a FRMI of its operational preparedness under  various stress events, where there may be large increases in the number or  value of claims.\xc2\xa0 </p>\r\n<p>To support portfolio risk management, stress testing  activities, and overall assessment of risks, a FRMI should rely on accurate, updated information on its insured mortgage loans (e.g., current outstanding insured  mortgage loan balances and other current, relevant information judged necessary  by the FRMI). </p>\r\n<h3>Reinsurance</h3>\r\n<p>Reinsurance is  often used as a risk mitigation strategy by insurers. However, reinsurance by a  mortgage insurer (i.e., ceding risk to a reinsurer) should not be used as a substitute  for sound mortgage insurance underwriting and for conducting adequate, ongoing  due diligence on lenders and borrowers. A FRMI that seeks to reinsure the risks  under its mortgage insurance policies should ensure compliance and consistency  with applicable laws, regulations and relevant guidelines.<sup id="fnb19-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb19"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>19</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Higher-Risk Insured Mortgage Loans </h3>\r\n<p>FRMIs  have the flexibility to insure a wide range of residential mortgage loans with  varying risk profiles. However, for a FRMI\xe2\x80\x99s insured residential mortgage loan  portfolios that constitute greater risks (as defined by the FRMI), OSFI expects  a FRMI to exercise heightened prudence through:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li class="margin-bottom-small">Greater Board and  Senior Management oversight of higher-risk insured loans;</li>\r\n  <li class="margin-bottom-small">Increased reporting to  and monitoring of higher-risk insured loans by Senior Management and the Board;</li>\r\n  <li class="margin-bottom-small">Clear, internally-set  limits on the insurance of higher-risk mortgage loans consistent with the RMIUP; </li>\r\n  <li class="margin-bottom-small">Stronger internal  controls (e.g., additional substantiation of credit qualification information,  enhanced credit approval processes, increased scrutiny by the risk management  oversight function, etc.); and </li>\r\n  <li class="margin-bottom-small">Increased oversight of  lenders with originations concentrated in higher risk mortgages.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>III. Guideline Administration</h2>\r\n<h3>Disclosure Requirements</h3>\r\n<p>Increased disclosure leads to greater transparency, clarity  and public confidence in FRMIs\xe2\x80\x99 residential mortgage insurance underwriting  practices. As a matter of principle, FRMIs should publicly disclose sufficient  information related to their residential mortgage insurance portfolios for  market participants to be able to conduct an adequate evaluation of the  soundness and condition of their residential mortgage insurance operations.</p>\r\n<p>FRMIs are expected to make public disclosures related to  residential mortgage insurance. Such disclosures should be carried out on a  quarterly basis, in a readily understandable format, and in a location generally  available to the public.</p>\r\n<p>The disclosures should include, but are not limited to, a breakdown  of information for residential mortgage loans insured during the quarter<sup id="fnb20-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb20"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>20</a></sup>,  as well as the total stock of insured mortgage loans (except where noted), with  further separation by mortgage insurance type (i.e., transactional- vs. portfolio-insured  loans), for the following categories: </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li class="margin-bottom-small"><strong>Volume</strong>: The  number and outstanding balance of insured mortgage loans;</li>\r\n  <li class="margin-bottom-small"><strong>Loan-to-Value</strong>: A breakdown of insured mortgage  loans according to LTV buckets of 5% increments (both estimated current LTV<sup id="fnb21-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb21"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>21</a></sup> and LTV at origination);</li>\r\n  <li class="margin-bottom-small"><strong>Amortization</strong>: Amortization  period ranges (e.g., 15 \xe2\x80\x93 19.9 years, 20 \xe2\x80\x93 24.9 years, \xe2\x89\xa5 25 years, etc.) at  origination and remaining amortization;</li>\r\n  <li class="margin-bottom-small"><strong>Geography</strong>: Geographic  breakdown by province and territory; and</li>\r\n  <li class="margin-bottom-small"><strong>Delinquencies</strong>: Breakdown of the  level of insured mortgage loan delinquencies (as a proportion for  the total stock of insured mortgage loans, as at the end of the period).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>FRMIs should also provide a discussion of the potential  impact an economic downturn may have on insured residential mortgage loans.</p>\r\n<h3>Supervision of FRMIs</h3>\r\n<h4>Information for Supervisory Purposes</h4>\r\n<p>Enhanced transparency and sound documentation will allow  OSFI to better understand the FRMI\xe2\x80\x99s financial position and economic impacts  and risks associated with a FRMI\xe2\x80\x99s residential mortgage insurance underwriting  practices and procedures. A FRMI should maintain and provide to OSFI, upon  request, its RMIUP and associated management reports.  A FRMI should promptly inform OSFI if it  becomes aware of any mortgage insurance underwriting issues that could  materially impact its financial condition.</p>\r\n<h4>Non-compliance with the Guideline</h4>\r\n<p>OSFI supervises FRMIs in order to determine whether they are  in sound financial condition and to promptly advise the FRMI Board and Senior  Management in the event that the institution is judged not to be in sound  financial condition or is not complying with supervisory requirements. OSFI is  required to take, or will require the Board and/or Senior Management to take,  necessary corrective measures to deal with prudential soundness issues in an  expeditious manner and to promote the adoption of policies and procedures  designed to control and manage risk by Senior Management and Boards.</p>\r\n<p>Where a FRMI fails to adequately account and control for the  risks of underwriting insurance for residential mortgage loans, on a  case-by-case basis, OSFI can take, or require the FRMI to take, corrective  measures. OSFI\xe2\x80\x99s actions can include heightened supervisory activity and/or discretionary  authority to require the FRMI to adjust its capital, commensurate with the  risks being undertaken by the FRMI.</p>\r\n<h2>IV.
