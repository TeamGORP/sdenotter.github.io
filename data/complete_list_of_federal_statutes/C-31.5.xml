of the law without discrimination;</Text></Provision><Provision format-ref="indent-0-0" language-align="no" list-item="no"><Text>WHEREAS the courts in a majority of the provinces and in one territory

have married in reliance on those court decisions;</Text></Provision><Provision format-ref="indent-0-0" language-align="no" list-item="no"><Text>WHEREAS only equal access to marriage for civil purposes would respect the right of couples of the same sex to equality without discrimination, and civil union, as an institution other than marriage, would not offer them that equal access and would

format-ref="indent-0-0" language-align="no" list-item="no"><Text>WHEREAS, in light of those considerations, the Parliament of Canada’s commitment to uphold the right to equality without discrimination precludes the use of section 33 of the <XRefExternal reference-type="act">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</XRefExternal> to deny the right of couples of the same sex to equal access to marriage for civil purposes;</Text></Provision><Provision format-ref="indent-0-0" language-align="no" list-item="no"><Text>WHEREAS marriage is a fundamental institution in Canadian society and the Parliament of Canada has a responsibility to support that institution because it strengthens commitment in relationships and represents the foundation of family life for many
