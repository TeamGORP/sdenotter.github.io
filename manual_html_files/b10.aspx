functions \r\n    and processes to meet the challenges of technological innovation, \r\n    increased specialization, cost control, and heightened competition. \r\n    However, outsourcing can increase an institution\xe2\x80\x99s dependence on \r\n    third parties, which may increase its risk profile. Many financial \r\n    sector regulators have responded by introducing guidance related \r\n    to the management of outsourcing risks. </p>\r\n  <p> This Guideline sets out OSFI\xe2\x80\x99s expectations for federally regulated \r\n    entities (FREs) that outsource, or contemplate outsourcing, one \r\n    or more of their business activities to a service provider. These \r\n    expectations should be considered prudent practices, procedures \r\n    or standards that should be applied according to the characteristics \r\n    of the outsourcing arrangement and the circumstances of the FRE. </p>\r\n  <p> FREs have the flexibility to configure their operations in the \r\n    way most suited to achieving their corporate objectives. However, \r\n    this Guideline operates on the premise that <strong>FREs retain \r\n    ultimate accountabilbity for all outsourced activities</strong>. \r\n    Furthermore, OSFI\xe2\x80\x98s supervisory powers should not be constrained, \r\n    irrespective of whether an activity is conducted in-house, outsourced, \r\n    or otherwise obtained from a third party. </p>\r\n  <p> Under this Guideline, FREs are expected to: </p>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li> evaluate the risks associated with all existing and proposed \r\n      outsourcing arrangements; </li>\r\n    <li> develop a process for determining the materiality of arrangements; </li>\r\n    <li> implement a program for managing and monitoring risks, commensurate \r\n      with the materiality of the arrangements; </li>\r\n    <li> ensure that the board of directors, chief agent or principal \r\n      officer receives information sufficient to enable them to discharge \r\n      their duties under this Guideline; and </li>\r\n    <li> refrain from outsourcing certain business activities to the \r\n      external auditor (see Section 4.3). </li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <p> OSFI\xe2\x80\x99s specific expectations may vary, depending on the nature \r\n    of the outsourcing arrangement being contemplated and the relationship \r\n    between the FRE and the service provider. As outlined in its <a href="/Eng/fi-if/rai-eri/sp-ps/Pages/sff.aspx"> <em>Supervisory Framework</em></a>, OSFI \r\n    applies a risk-based approach to assessing an FRE\xe2\x80\x99s safety and soundness \r\n    on a consolidated basis. Resources are focused on areas of higher \r\n    risk and information from other regulators is used as appropriate. \r\n    For each activity that OSFI identifies as significant <sup id="fnb2-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb2"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>2</a></sup>, \r\n    OSFI assesses the level of risk, including regulatory risk, and \r\n    considers the impact of risk mitigation by evaluating the quality \r\n    of risk management. Institutions that are well managed relative \r\n    to their risks will require less supervision. Therefore, as part \r\n    of OSFI\xe2\x80\x99s risk- focused supervisory process, an institution\xe2\x80\x99s policies \r\n    and procedures for assessing the materiality of outsourcing arrangements \r\n    and managing the risks associated with outsourcing arrangements, \r\n    may be evaluated against the expectations of this Guideline. In \r\n    addition, individual outsourcing arrangements may be subject to \r\n    supervisory review. </p>\r\n  <div class="span-4 module-table-contents">\r\n    <h2>Table of Contents</h2>\r\n    <ul class="list-bullet-none">\r\n      <li> <a href="#mozTocId71659">Subject: Outsourcing of Business Activities, \r\n        Functions and Processes</a> </li>\r\n      <li> <a href="#mozTocId552120">1.

Application of the Guideline</h2>\r\n  <p> This Guideline applies to all the outsourcing arrangements of \r\n    an FRE or an FRE group. In addition, in applying this Guideline, \r\n    the FRE is expected to consider the impact on the FRE and on its \r\n    consolidated operations, of outsourcing arrangements entered into \r\n    by all its subsidiaries and business operations, including those \r\n    located in foreign jurisdictions. OSFI expects the FRE to ensure \r\n    that its subsidiaries and branches follow the guideline when entering \r\n    into material outsourcing arrangements. </p>\r\n  <p> All outsourcing arrangements should be subjected to the materiality \r\n    assessment set out in Section 6 of the Guideline. OSFI recognizes \r\n    that outsourcing arrangements will exhibit varying degrees of materiality \r\n    and expects that the robustness of an FRE\xe2\x80\x99s management of outsourcing \r\n    risks would be commensurate with the materiality of the arrangement. </p>\r\n  <p> With respect to outsourcing arrangements that are deemed material, \r\n    the FRE is expected to follow the full risk management program detailed \r\n    in Section 7. However, reduced expectations may be applied, in a \r\n    manner consistent with Sections 4.1 and 4.2 respectively, where \r\n    the material outsourcing arrangement is between an FRE and a member \r\n    of an FRE Group, or between an FRE and a member of an RFIP Group. \r\n    FREs may consult with OSFI when they are uncertain how to assess \r\n    a particular combination of intra-group arrangements. </p>\r\n  <p> With respect to outsourcing arrangements that are deemed clearly \r\n    immaterial, the FRE is not expected to follow the risk management \r\n    program outlined in this Guideline. An FRE should not outsource \r\n    certain activities to its external auditor (see Section 4.3). </p>\r\n  <h3 id="mozTocId999797">4.1 Material FRE Intra-group Outsourcing Arrangements </h3>\r\n  <p> At a minimum, OSFI expects the following to be addressed when \r\n    a member of an FRE group enters into a material outsourcing arrangement \r\n    with another entity that is a member of the same FRE group (Section \r\n    3.2.1): </p>\r\n  <ol class="list-lower-alpha">\r\n    <li> an outsourcing agreement that details, among other things, \r\n      the scope of the arrangement, the services to be supplied, the \r\n      nature of the relationship between the FRE and the service provider, \r\n      and procedures governing the subcontracting of services; </li>\r\n    <li> an appropriate business continuity plan; </li>\r\n    <li> a process for monitoring and oversight; and </li>\r\n    <li> legislative requirements relating to location of records (Section \r\n      7.2.2). </li>\r\n  </ol>\r\n  <p> As appropriate, a parent FRE may address these expectations within \r\n    enterprise-wide processes or plans, so long as any specific risks \r\n    to each subsidiary are dealt with, and the board of directors is \r\n    able to fulfill its accountabilities. As well, a parent FRE may \r\n    establish the program, approve the policies, and develop and maintain \r\n    the reporting on behalf of its FRE subsidiaries. </p>\r\n  <p> Consistent with the risk-based <a href="/Eng/fi-if/rai-eri/sp-ps/Pages/sff.aspx"><em>Supervisory \r\n    Framework</em></a>, OSFI may have additional expectations for FRE \r\n    Group arrangements, depending on the risks related to the outsourcing \r\n    arrangement and the conclusions of OSFI\xe2\x80\x99s supervisory review. </p>\r\n  <h3 id="mozTocId66571">4.2 Material RFIP Intra-group Outsourcing Arrangements</h3>\r\n  <p> At a minimum, OSFI expects the following to be addressed when \r\n    a Canadian branch or a Canadian subsidiary enters into a material \r\n    outsourcing arrangement with a member of its RFIP group (Section \r\n    3.2.2): </p>\r\n  <ol class="list-lower-alpha">\r\n    <li> a due diligence process that addresses the qualitative aspects \r\n      of the arrangement, particularly those pertaining to the unique \r\n      operational requirements of the FRE; </li>\r\n    <li> an outsourcing agreement that details, among other things, \r\n      the scope of the arrangement, the services to be supplied, the \r\n      nature of the relationship between the FRE and the service provider \r\n      (e.g., roles, responsibilities and expectations), and that addresses \r\n      the items set out in Section 7.2.1, as appropriate; </li>\r\n    <li> procedures governing the subcontracting of services; </li>\r\n    <li> an appropriate business continuity plan; </li>\r\n    <li> a process for monitoring and oversight; and </li>\r\n    <li> legislative requirements relating to location of records (Section \r\n      7.2.2). </li>\r\n  </ol>\r\n  <p> Consistent with the risk-based <a href="/Eng/fi-if/rai-eri/sp-ps/Pages/sff.aspx"><em>Supervisory \r\n    Framework</em></a>, OSFI may have additional expectations for RFIP \r\n    Group arrangements, depending on the risks related to the outsourcing \r\n    arrangement and the conclusions of OSFI\xe2\x80\x99s supervisory review. </p>\r\n  <h3 id="mozTocId719031">4.3 Outsourcing Arrangements with the External \r\n    Auditor </h3>\r\n  <p> Prior to obtaining non-audit services from its external auditor, \r\n    the FRE should assure itself that, for the services to be performed \r\n    by the external auditor for that particular FRE, its external auditor \r\n    would be in compliance with the relevant auditor independence standards \r\n    of the Canadian accounting profession, as well as any other applicable \r\n    auditor independence requirements. </p>\r\n  <p> In addition, the FRE should not outsource the following activities \r\n    to its external auditor: </p>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li> Any actuarial service, unless it is reasonable to conclude \r\n      that the results of the service will not be subject to audit procedures \r\n      during an audit of the FRE\'s financial statements. For this purpose, \r\n      actuarial services relates to the determination of an amount to \r\n      be recorded in the financial statements of the FRE or work normally \r\n      undertaken by its appointed actuary<sup id="fnb6-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb6"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>6</a></sup>, and does \r\n      not include services that involve assisting the FRE in understanding \r\n      the methods, models, assumptions and inputs used, and advising \r\n      management on the appropriate actuarial methods and assumptions \r\n      that will be used. Consistent with Guideline E-15 (Appointed Actuary: \r\n      Legal Requirements, Qualifications and External Review), the FRE \r\n      may use an actuary working in the company\'s external auditor firm \r\n      for the external review of the appointed actuary\'s work and reports. </li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li> Any internal audit service related to the internal accounting \r\n      controls, financial systems, or financial statements of the FRE, \r\n      unless it is reasonable to conclude that the results of the service \r\n      will not be subject to audit procedures during an audit of the \r\n      FRE\'s financial statements. This does not prohibit the external \r\n      auditor from providing a non-recurring service to evaluate a discrete \r\n      item or program, if the service is not, in substance, the outsourcing \r\n      of an internal audit function. </li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <h2 id="mozTocId431919"> 5. Accountability and Control</h2>\r\n  <h3 id="mozTocId730300">5.1 FRE Board of Directors Responsibilities</h3>\r\n  <p> As set out in the <a href="/Eng/fi-if/rg-ro/gdn-ort/gl-ld/Pages/CG_Guideline.aspx"><em>OSFI Corporate \r\n    Governance Guideline</em></a>, the board, or a committee of the \r\n    board, is expected to ensure that an FRE has appropriate risk management \r\n    policies and practices and that these are regularly reviewed. In \r\n    terms of the specific risks arising from outsourcing, it is expected \r\n    that, in carrying out this duty, the board would periodically: </p>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li> approve or reaffirm the policies that apply to outsourcing \r\n      arrangements (e.g., risk philosophy, materiality criteria, risk \r\n      management program and approval limits); and </li>\r\n    <li> review a list of all the FRE\xe2\x80\x99s material outsourcing arrangements \r\n      (see Section 7.3.1) and other relevant reports, when appropriate. </li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <h3 id="mozTocId358989">5.2 FRE Management Responsibilities </h3>\r\n  <p> Management is responsible for:</p>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li> developing outsourcing policies for board approval; </li>\r\n    <li> implementing the policies and any associated procedures; </li>\r\n    <li> periodically reviewing their effectiveness; and </li>\r\n    <li> communicating information pertaining to significant outsourcing \r\n      risks to the board in a timely manner. </li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <p> The policies and procedures are expected to include: </p>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li> 1) An outsourcing risk philosophy\r\n      <p> The FRE\xe2\x80\x99s outsourcing risk philosophy would generally comprise \r\n        a statement of principles, the basis for decision making, and \r\n        the parameters for controlling outsourcing risks. Outsourcing \r\n        risk philosophies will vary between FREs, but should address \r\n        the following: </p>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li> Integration of outsourcing arrangements, both individually \r\n          and in aggregate, with overall business and strategic objectives. \r\n          This could include an identification of any functions that, \r\n          for strategic or internal control reasons, the FRE would not \r\n          contemplate outsourcing. </li>\r\n        <li> Importance and adequacy of internal expertise and management \r\n          frameworks to oversee and manage the outsourced activity and \r\n          the relationship with the service provider. </li>\r\n        <li> Business case for outsourcing a significant business activity. \r\n          The business case should consider the short- and long-term \r\n          cost implications and all relevant prudential matters. When \r\n          the service is being supplied from a foreign jurisdiction, \r\n          the FRE should identify the issues that may arise as a result \r\n          of the differing and potentially conflicting requirements \r\n          among jurisdictions. The business case should also consider \r\n          the cumulative impacts of all outsourcing arrangements on \r\n          the overall safety and soundness of the FRE. </li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> 2) A materiality assessment for outsourcing arrangements\r\n      <p> This assessment is expected to identify both the processes \r\n        for determining the materiality of individual outsourcing arrangements \r\n        and the underlying materiality factors such as those set out \r\n        in Section 6. </p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>3) An outsourcing risk management program that, at a minimum, \r\n      includes the expectations contained in Section 7 and is applied \r\n      consistently throughout the FRE, including operations located \r\n      in foreign jurisdictions.

The chief agent or principal officer remains \r\n    accountable for the business in Canada, regardless of whether a \r\n    particular business activity takes place in Canada or has been outsourced. </p>\r\n  <p> OSFI expects the chief agent or principal officer to ensure that \r\n    the branch has risk management policies for outsourcing and that \r\n    the expectations set out in Section 5.2 of this Guideline are met. \r\n    In particular, the chief agent or principal officer would be expected \r\n    to: </p>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li> ensure that materiality assessment criteria are developed and \r\n      applied; </li>\r\n    <li> ensure that the risk management program is applied; and </li>\r\n    <li> within a reasonable time advise its OSFI relationship manager \r\n      (either formally or informally) about any events that are likely \r\n      to have a significant negative impact on the delivery of the service \r\n      provided for by a material outsourcing arrangement. </li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <h2 id="mozTocId692372">6. Materiality Assessment for Outsourcing \r\n    Arrangements </h2>\r\n  <p> As outlined in Section 4, OSFI recognizes that the outsourcing \r\n    arrangements undertaken by an FRE will have differing degrees of \r\n    materiality and may not be readily classified as either material \r\n    or immaterial. In general, OSFI expects that an FRE will design \r\n    a risk management program that applies to all its outsourcing arrangements, \r\n    except those that are clearly immaterial, and that the risk mitigants \r\n    employed under this program will be appropriate to the particular \r\n    outsourcing arrangement. As such, the risk management program could \r\n    be scaled to apply different requirements depending on the type \r\n    of outsourcing arrangement. Those arrangements deemed material should \r\n    be subject to the full expectations set out in Section 7, unless \r\n    it is reasonable to conclude that a particular expectation is not \r\n    appropriate for the outsourcing arrangement in question. OSFI may \r\n    review an FRE\xe2\x80\x99s materiality assessment on a case-by-case basis as \r\n    part of the supervisory review process. </p>\r\n  <p> The materiality of an outsourcing arrangement will depend on the \r\n    extent to which it has the potential to have an important influence \r\n    \xe2\x80\x93 whether quantitative or qualitative \xe2\x80\x93 on a significant line of \r\n    business of the consolidated operations of the FRE or the Canadian \r\n    operations of a foreign branch or subsidiary. </p>\r\n  <p> The assessment of the materiality of an outsourcing arrangement \r\n    is often subjective and depends on the circumstances faced by an \r\n    individual FRE. Without limiting the scope of the materiality assessment, \r\n    factors that the FRE should consider include: </p>\r\n  <ol class="list-lower-alpha">\r\n    <li> the impact of the outsourcing arrangement on the finances, \r\n      reputation and operations of the FRE, or a significant business \r\n      line, particularly if the service provider, or group of affiliated \r\n      service providers, should fail to perform over a given period \r\n      of time; </li>\r\n    <li> the ability of the FRE to maintain appropriate internal controls \r\n      and meet regulatory requirements, particularly if the service \r\n      provider were to experience problems; </li>\r\n    <li> the cost of the outsourcing arrangement; </li>\r\n    <li> the degree of difficulty and time required to find an alternative \r\n      service provider or to bring the business activity \xe2\x80\x98in-house\xe2\x80\x99; \r\n      and </li>\r\n    <li> the potential that multiple outsourcing arrangements provided \r\n      by the same service provider can have an important influence \xe2\x80\x93 \r\n      in aggregate \xe2\x80\x93 on the FRE<sup id="fnb7-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb7"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>7</a></sup>. </li>\r\n  </ol>\r\n  <p> Specific questions an FRE might consider in assessing the materiality \r\n    of outsourcing arrangements are set out in Annex 2. </p>\r\n  <p> Outsourcing all or substantially all of a management oversight \r\n    function should always be considered material, except in circumstances \r\n    where the FRE receives such services from another member of the \r\n    FRE Group. For the purpose of this Guideline, management oversight \r\n    functions include: </p>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li> financial analysis; </li>\r\n    <li> compliance; </li>\r\n    <li> any internal audit services related to the internal accounting \r\n      controls, financial systems, or financial statements; </li>\r\n    <li> senior management; and </li>\r\n    <li> risk management. </li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <p> For example, a material arrangement could relate to the outsourcing \r\n    of a significant part of the FRE\xe2\x80\x99s information technology function, \r\n    investment management, or loan processing. Arrangements that likely \r\n    do not represent material outsourcing include those where there \r\n    are numerous similar providers in the marketplace and the cost and \r\n    inconvenience of switching between providers is low. </p>\r\n  <p> Significant changes in the volume or the nature of business conducted \r\n    should cause the FRE to reassess an outsourcing arrangement\xe2\x80\x99s materiality. \r\n    In cases where an arrangement is reassessed as material, it should \r\n    come into compliance with all aspects of this Guideline at the first \r\n    opportunity, such as when the outsourcing contract, agreement or \r\n    statement of work (where applicable) is substantively amended, renewed \r\n    or extended. </p>\r\n  <h2 id="mozTocId150765"> 7. Risk Management Program for Material Outsourcing \r\n    Arrangements </h2>\r\n  <p> In general, OSFI expects that an FRE will design a risk management \r\n    program that applies to all outsourcing arrangements of the FRE \r\n    group, except those that are clearly immaterial, and that the risk \r\n    mitigants employed will be commensurate with the FRE\xe2\x80\x99s assessment \r\n    of the risks associated with the particular outsourcing arrangement. </p>\r\n  <h3 id="mozTocId246566">7.1 Due Diligence Processes </h3>\r\n  <p> OSFI expects an FRE to conduct an internal due diligence to determine \r\n    the nature and scope of the business activity to be outsourced, \r\n    its relationship to the rest of the FRE\xe2\x80\x99s activities, and how the \r\n    activity is managed. </p>\r\n  <p> In selecting a service provider, or substantially amending or \r\n    renewing a contract or outsourcing agreement, FREs are expected \r\n    to undertake a due diligence process that fully assesses the risks \r\n    associated with the outsourcing arrangement, and addresses all relevant \r\n    aspects of the service provider, including qualitative (i.e., operational) \r\n    and quantitative (i.e., financial) factors (see Annex 3 for a list \r\n    of factors that could be included when performing due diligence \r\n    of a service provider). When out-of-Canada outsourcing is being \r\n    contemplated, the FRE should pay particular attention to the legal \r\n    requirements of that jurisdiction, as well as the potential foreign \r\n    political, economic and social conditions, and events that may conspire \r\n    to reduce the foreign service provider\xe2\x80\x99s ability to provide the \r\n    service, as well as any additional risk factors that may require \r\n    adjustment to the risk management program. </p>\r\n  <p> Due diligence processes will vary depending on the FRE and on \r\n    the nature of the outsourcing arrangement being contemplated. For \r\n    example, in the case of renewals where no material change has occurred \r\n    that would affect the viability of the outsourcing relationship, \r\n    it may be appropriate to conduct more streamlined due diligence. \r\n    If the service provider is a member of an RFIP Group, a streamlined \r\n    due diligence process may be followed that addresses the qualitative \r\n    aspects of the arrangement, particularly those pertaining to the \r\n    unique operational (e.g., Canadian) requirements of the FRE. </p>\r\n  <p> The FRE may rely on a due diligence review of the service provider \r\n    that has been performed by an affiliate or home office within the \r\n    previous 15 months, provided the review addresses the above-noted \r\n    requirements as well as the risks particular to the FRE. </p>\r\n  <h3 id="mozTocId264410">7.2 Policies and Procedures to Manage Risks \r\n    Associated with Material Outsourcing Arrangements </h3>\r\n  <h4 id="mozTocId763001">7.2.1 Contract for Services</h4>\r\n  <p> OSFI expects material outsourcing arrangements to be documented \r\n    by a written contract that addresses all elements of the arrangement \r\n    and has been reviewed by the FRE\xe2\x80\x99s legal counsel. Some of the items \r\n    identified below may not be applicable in all circumstances; however, \r\n    FREs are expected to address all issues relevant to managing the \r\n    risks associated with each outsourcing arrangement to the extent \r\n    feasible and reasonable given the circumstances, and having regard \r\n    to the interests of the FRE. FRE and RFIP intra-group outsourcing \r\n    arrangements can be documented by an outsourcing agreement that \r\n    meets the expectations set out in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 respectively. </p>\r\n  <p> <em>a) Nature and Scope of the Service Being Provided</em></p>\r\n  <p> The contract or outsourcing agreement is expected to specify the \r\n    scope of the relationship, which may include provisions that address \r\n    the frequency, content and format of the service being provided. \r\n    The contract or outsourcing agreement is expected to detail the \r\n    physical location where the service provider will provide the service. </p>\r\n  <p><em> b) Performance Measures</em></p>\r\n  <p> Performance measures should be established that allow each party \r\n    to determine whether the commitments contained in the contract are \r\n    being fulfilled. </p>\r\n  <p> <em>c) Reporting Requirements</em> </p>\r\n  <p> The contract or outsourcing agreement is expected to specify the \r\n    type and frequency of information the FRE receives from the service \r\n    provider. This would include reports that allow the FRE to assess \r\n    whether the performance measures are being met and any other information \r\n    required for the FRE\xe2\x80\x99s monitoring program (see Section 7.3). In \r\n    addition, the contract or outsourcing agreement is expected to include \r\n    procedures and requirements for the service provider to report events \r\n    to the FRE that may have the potential to materially affect the \r\n    delivery of the service. </p>\r\n  <p> <em>d) Resolution of Differences </em></p>\r\n  <p> OSFI expects the contract or outsourcing agreement to incorporate \r\n    a protocol for resolving disputes. The contract or outsourcing agreement \r\n    should specify whether the service provider must continue providing \r\n    the service during a dispute and the resolution period, as well \r\n    as the jurisdiction and rules under which the dispute will be settled. </p>\r\n  <p> <em> e) Defaults and Termination</em> </p>\r\n  <p> The contract or outsourcing agreement is expected to specify what \r\n    constitutes a default, identify remedies, and allow for opportunities \r\n    to cure defaults or terminate the agreement. The FRE is expected \r\n    to ensure that it can reasonably continue to process information \r\n    and sustain operations in the event that the outsourcing arrangement \r\n    is terminated or the service provider is unable to supply the service. \r\n    Appropriate notice should be required for termination of service \r\n    and the FRE\xe2\x80\x99s assets should be returned in a timely fashion. In \r\n    particular, data and records relating to data processing outsourcing \r\n    arrangements should be returned to the FRE in a format that would \r\n    allow the FRE to sustain business operations without prohibitive \r\n    expense. </p>\r\n  <p> The contract or outsourcing agreement should not contain wording \r\n    that precludes the service from being continued in situations where \r\n    the Superintendent takes control of the FRE, or where the FRE is \r\n    in liquidation. </p>\r\n  <p> <em> f) Ownership and Access</em></p>\r\n  <p> Identification and ownership of all assets (intellectual and physical) \r\n    related to the outsourcing arrangement should be clearly established, \r\n    including assets generated or purchased pursuant to the outsourcing \r\n    arrangement. The contract or outsourcing agreement should state \r\n    whether and how the service provider has the right to use the FRE\xe2\x80\x99s \r\n    assets (e.g., data, hardware and software, system documentation \r\n    or intellectual property) and the FRE\xe2\x80\x99s right of access to those \r\n    assets. </p>\r\n  <p> <em>g) Contingency Planning</em> </p>\r\n  <p> The contract or outsourcing agreement should outline the service \r\n    provider\xe2\x80\x99s measures for ensuring the continuation of the outsourced \r\n    business activity in the event of problems and events that may affect \r\n    the service provider\xe2\x80\x99s operation, including systems breakdown and \r\n    natural disaster, and other reasonably foreseeable events. The FRE \r\n    should ensure that the service provider regularly tests its business \r\n    recovery system as it pertains to the outsourced activity, </p>\r\n  <p> notifies the FRE of the test results, and addresses any material \r\n    deficiencies. The FRE is expected to provide a summary of the test \r\n    results to OSFI upon reasonable notice. In addition, the FRE should \r\n    be notified in the event that the service provider makes significant \r\n    changes to its business resumption and contingency plans, or encounters \r\n    other circumstances that might have a serious impact on the service. </p>\r\n  <p> <em>h) Audit Rights</em></p>\r\n  <p> The contract or outsourcing agreement is expected to clearly stipulate \r\n    the audit requirements and rights of both the service provider and \r\n    the FRE. At a minimum, it should give the FRE the right to evaluate \r\n    the service provided or, alternatively to cause an independent auditor \r\n    to evaluate, on its behalf, the service provided. This includes \r\n    a review of the service provider\xe2\x80\x99s internal control environment \r\n    as it relates to the service being provided<sup id="fnb8-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb8"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>8</a></sup>. </p>\r\n  <p> In addition, in all situations, irrespective of whether an activity \r\n    is conducted in-house, outsourced, or otherwise obtained from a \r\n    third party, OSFI retains its supervisory powers<sup id="fnb9-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb9"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>9</a></sup>. \r\n    Accordingly, an undertaking from the service provider or a provision \r\n    in the outsourcing contract, should give OSFI or the Superintendent\'s \r\n    representative the right to: </p>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li> exercise the contractual rights of the FRE relating to audit; </li>\r\n    <li> accompany the FRE (or its independent auditor) when it exercises \r\n      its contractual audit rights; </li>\r\n    <li> access and make copies of any internal audit reports (and associated \r\n      working papers and recommendations) prepared by or for the service \r\n      provider in respect of the service being performed for the FRE, \r\n      subject to OSFI agreeing to sign appropriate confidentiality documentation \r\n      in form and content satisfactory to the service provider; and </li>\r\n    <li> access findings in the external audit of the service provider \r\n      (and associated working papers and recommendations) that address \r\n      the service being performed for the FRE, subject to the consent \r\n      of the service provider\xe2\x80\x99s external auditor and OSFI agreeing to \r\n      sign appropriate confidentiality documentation in form and content \r\n      satisfactory to the service provider and the external auditor. </li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <p> OSFI would provide the FRE with reasonable notice of its intent \r\n    to exercise its audit rights and would share its findings with the \r\n    FRE where appropriate. In the normal course, OSFI would seek to \r\n    obtain information it requires through the FRE itself. </p>\r\n  <h4> i) Subcontracting </h4>\r\n  <p> The contract or outsourcing agreement is expected to set out any \r\n    rules or limitations to subcontracting by the service provider. \r\n    In particular, security and confidentiality standards should apply \r\n    to subcontracting or outsourcing arrangements by the primary service \r\n    provider. Consistent with the principles of this Guideline, the \r\n    audit and inspection rights of the FRE and OSFI should continue \r\n    to apply to all significant subcontracting arrangements. </p>\r\n  <h4> j) Confidentiality, Security and Separation of Property</h4>\r\n  <p> At a minimum, the contract or outsourcing agreement is expected \r\n    to set out the FRE\xe2\x80\x99s requirements for confidentiality and security. \r\n    Ideally, the security and confidentiality policies adopted by the \r\n    service provider would be commensurate with those of the FRE and \r\n    should meet a reasonable standard in the circumstances. The contract \r\n    or outsourcing agreement should address which party has responsibility \r\n    for protection mechanisms, the scope of the information to be protected, \r\n    the powers of each party to change security procedures and requirements, \r\n    which party may be liable for any losses that might result from \r\n    a security breach, and notification requirements if there is a breach \r\n    of security. </p>\r\n  <p> OSFI expects appropriate security and data confidentiality protections \r\n    to be in place. The service provider is expected to be able to logically \r\n    isolate the FRE\xe2\x80\x99s data, records, and items in process from those \r\n    of other clients at all times, including under adverse conditions. </p>\r\n  <h4> k) Pricing </h4>\r\n  <p> The contract or outsourcing agreement should fully describe the \r\n    basis for calculating fees and compensation relating to the service \r\n    being provided. </p>\r\n  <h4> l) Insurance</h4>\r\n  <p> The service provider should be required to notify the FRE about \r\n    significant changes in insurance coverage and disclose general terms \r\n    and conditions of the insurance coverage. </p>\r\n  <h4 id="mozTocId396219">7.2.2 Location of Records</h4>\r\n  <p> In accordance with the federal financial institutions legislation, \r\n    certain records<sup id="fnb10-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb10"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>10</a></sup> of entities carrying on business in Canada should be maintained \r\n    in Canada. In addition, the FRE is expected to ensure that OSFI \r\n    can access in Canada any records necessary to enable OSFI to fulfill \r\n    its mandate. </p>\r\n  <h4 id="mozTocId543743">7.2.3 Business Continuity Plan</h4>\r\n  <p> An FRE\xe2\x80\x99s business continuity plan should address reasonably foreseeable \r\n    situations (either temporary or permanent) where the service provider \r\n    fails to continue providing service. The business continuity plan \r\n    and back-up systems should be commensurate with the risk of a service \r\n    disruption. In particular, the FRE\xe2\x80\x99s business continuity plan should \r\n    ensure that the FRE has in its possession, or can readily access, \r\n    all records necessary to allow it to sustain business operations, \r\n    meet its statutory obligations, and provide all information as may \r\n    be required by OSFI to meet its mandate, in the event the service \r\n    provider is unable to provide the service. </p>\r\n  <h4 id="mozTocId824196">7.2.4 Outsourcing in Foreign Jurisdictions</h4>\r\n  <p> When the material outsourcing arrangement results in services \r\n    being provided in a foreign jurisdiction, the FRE\xe2\x80\x99s risk management \r\n    program should be enhanced to address any additional concerns linked \r\n    to the economic and political environment, technological sophistication, \r\n    and the legal and regulatory risk profile of the foreign jurisdiction(s). </p>\r\n  <h3 id="mozTocId957596">7.3 Monitoring and Oversight of Material Outsourcing \r\n    Arrangements </h3>\r\n  <p> Every FRE engaged in material outsourcing should develop, implement \r\n    and oversee procedures to monitor and control outsourcing risks \r\n    in accordance with its outsourcing risk-management policies. The \r\n    sophistication of the procedures should be commensurate with the \r\n    size and complexity of the outsourcing arrangement(s) and with the \r\n    expectations of this Guideline. Management is expected to prepare \r\n    reports based on the FRE\xe2\x80\x99s monitoring and oversight activities. \r\n    These reports may outline the success of the outsourcing arrangement \r\n    and the effectiveness of the risk management program and may be \r\n    reflected in the documentation delivered to the FRE\xe2\x80\x99s board of directors. \r\n    Reports based on the Canadian branch\xe2\x80\x99s monitoring and oversight \r\n    activities should either be prepared or reviewed by the chief agent \r\n    or principal officer. </p>\r\n  <h4 id="mozTocId340971">7.3.1 Centralized List of All Material Outsourcing \r\n    Arrangements </h4>\r\n  <p> The FRE should maintain a centralized list of all its material \r\n    outsourcing arrangements<sup id="fnb11-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb11"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>11</a></sup>. \r\n    A parent FRE may maintain the list on behalf of its subsidiaries. \r\n    The list should contain information pertaining to the name of the \r\n    service provider, the country where the service is provided, the \r\n    expiry or renewal date of the contract or outsourcing agreement \r\n    and the estimated value (dollar amount) of the contract or outsourcing \r\n    agreement. A template of a centralized list that a FRE could use \r\n    is provided in Annex 4. The list should be updated on an ongoing \r\n    basis and should form part of the documentation delivered to the \r\n    FRE board of directors or the branch\xe2\x80\x99s chief agent or principal \r\n    officer. OSFI should have access to the list at any time upon request. </p>\r\n  <h4 id="mozTocId631964">7.3.2 Monitoring the Outsourcing Arrangement </h4>\r\n  <p> The FRE should monitor all material outsourcing arrangements to \r\n    ensure that the service is being delivered in the manner expected \r\n    and in accordance with the terms of the contract or outsourcing \r\n    agreement. Monitoring may take the form of regular, formal meetings \r\n    with the service provider and/or periodic reviews of the outsourcing \r\n    arrangement\xe2\x80\x99s performance measures. Within a reasonable time, the \r\n    FRE should advise its OSFI relationship manager about any events \r\n    that are likely to have a significant negative impact on the delivery \r\n    of the service. </p>\r\n  <p> An FRE should review its material outsourcing arrangements to \r\n    ensure compliance with its outsourcing risk policies and procedures \r\n    and with the expectations of this Guideline. Reviews of material \r\n    outsourcing arrangements should be periodically undertaken by the \r\n    FRE\xe2\x80\x99s internal audit department or another independent review function \r\n    either internal or external to the FRE, provided it has the appropriate \r\n    knowledge and skills. The FRE\xe2\x80\x99s board of directors, or the chief \r\n    agent or principal officer when the FRE is a branch, will always \r\n    retain overall accountability for the outsourcing arrangement. Reviews \r\n    should test the FRE\xe2\x80\x99s risk-management activities for outsourcing \r\n    in order to: </p>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li> ensure risk-management policies and procedures for outsourcing \r\n      are being followed; </li>\r\n    <li> ensure effective management controls over outsourcing activities; </li>\r\n    <li> verify the adequacy and accuracy of management information \r\n      reports; and </li>\r\n    <li> ensure that personnel involved in risk-management for outsourcing \r\n      are aware of the FRE\xe2\x80\x99s risk-management policies and have the expertise \r\n      required to make effective decisions consistent with those policies. </li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <p> Management should adjust the scope of the review depending on \r\n    the nature of the outsourcing arrangement. </p>\r\n  <h4 id="mozTocId625160">7.3.3 Monitoring the Service Provider</h4>\r\n  <p> At least annually, the FRE should review the service provider \r\n    to ascertain its ability to continue to deliver the service in the \r\n    manner expected. This review would be commensurate with the level \r\n    of risk involved and could include an assessment of the service \r\n    provider\xe2\x80\x99s circumstances including its financial strength, prospects \r\n    (except in cases involving the parent or home office of a Canadian \r\n    subsidiary or branch), technical competence, and use and performance \r\n    of significant subcontractors. </p>\r\n  <p class="align-center"> - END - </p>\r\n  <h2 id="mozTocId498097">Annex 1 - Examples of Outsourcing Arrangements </h2>\r\n  <p> The outsourcing domain is diverse and growing.
