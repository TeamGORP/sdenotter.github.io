<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>\r\n            <p> The fight against financial crime is an ongoing priority for governments \r\n              around the world. The ability of criminals and criminal organizations \r\n              to use financial institutions to launder funds, along with the potential \r\n              risk to their reputations, and ultimately to their safety and soundness, \r\n              continues to be a concern for financial and other regulators. Over \r\n              the past several years there has been extensive action in many countries \r\n              to implement permanent measures to fight money laundering and terrorist \r\n              financing. This action has been driven largely by the leadership \r\n              of the FATF, of which Canada is a founding member. </p>\r\n            <p> The FATF is the intergovernmental body that develops, monitors \r\n              and evaluates country AML/ATF standards. These standards as set \r\n              out in its 40 AML Recommendations and 9 ATF Recommendations establish \r\n              a strong AML/ATF framework and permit a risk-based approach to the \r\n              implementation of preventative measures. </p>\r\n            <p> The Government of Canada, led by the Department of Finance, has \r\n              established a private/public sector advisory committee to gather \r\n              information, on an ongoing basis, on how Canada\xe2\x80\x99s AML/ATF regime \r\n              can be continuously reviewed. The federal Government also implemented \r\n              significant changes to the PCMLTFA and PCMLTFR in 2007/2008 to ensure \r\n              that the AML/ATF legislative framework is in line with international \r\n              standards. </p>\r\n            <p> OSFI\xe2\x80\x99s mandate includes supervising financial soundness and promoting \r\n              the adoption, by management and Boards of FRFIs, of policies and \r\n              procedures designed to mitigate risk. OSFI believes that the risk \r\n              management outcomes identified in this Guideline will further reduce \r\n              the susceptibility of FRFIs to being used by individuals or organizations \r\n              to launder funds and fight terrorist financing, thereby reducing \r\n              their exposure to damage to their reputation, a key asset in the \r\n              financial services industry. </p>\r\n            <p> To the extent possible, OSFI has aligned this Guideline to the \r\n              framework of AML/ATF preventative measures set out in the FATF Recommendations. \r\n              OSFI believes this will help focus attention on the principal goals \r\n              of risk-based deterrence and detection. </p>\r\n              <div

compliance with Part 1 of \r\n              the PCMLTFA, and the PCMLTFR. These prescribe a compliance program \r\n              with a risk-based component designed to ensure effective control \r\n              over ML and TF risks. </p>\r\n            <p> This Guideline does not create any new regulatory requirements. \r\n              It is intended to assist FRFIs in identifying and complying with \r\n              applicable AML/ATF requirements and measures contained in the PCMLTFA \r\n              and the PCMLTFR. This Guideline is also aimed at helping institutions \r\n              meet OSFI\'s governance and control expectations. </p>\r\n            <p> Effective control over ML and TF risks, and related regulatory, \r\n              operational and reputation risks, is essential. </p>\r\n            <p> In order to achieve effective control, FRFIs will adopt different \r\n              approaches to their AML/ATF programs that take into account the \r\n              nature, scope, complexity and risk profile of their institution. \r\n              FRFIs are expected to take into account the contents of this Guideline \r\n              when implementing their AML/ATF programs. OSFI\'s AML/ATF assessment \r\n              program, which aims to assist OSFI in evaluating the effectiveness \r\n              of controls, takes the foregoing into consideration in the assessment \r\n              of individual institutions. </p>\r\n            <p> The OSFI Act enables OSFI and FINTRAC to exchange information \r\n              on FRFIs\xe2\x80\x99 compliance with Part 1 of the PCMLTFA. To this end, on \r\n              June 14, 2004, OSFI and FINTRAC signed a Memorandum of Understanding \r\n              for exchanging information. FRFIs should also be aware that in December \r\n              2008, FINTRAC will be able to impose administrative monetary penalties \r\n              against its reporting entities, including FRFIs, for violations \r\n              of prescribed provisions of the PCMLTFA and PCMLTFR. </p>\r\n            <p> FRFIs should note that FINTRAC, as the agency responsible for \r\n              ensuring compliance with Part 1 of the PCMLTFA, and the PCMLTFR, \r\n              publishes and maintains its own Guidelines on compliance with the \r\n              PCMLTFA and the PCMLTFR. OSFI has made every effort not to duplicate \r\n              in substance FINTRAC guidance. This Guideline should therefore be \r\n              read in conjunction with FINTRAC\xe2\x80\x99s Guidelines, as appropriate. Where \r\n              we do refer to matters touched on in FINTRAC\xe2\x80\x99s Guidelines, we have \r\n              conformed references to those used by FINTRAC. </p>\r\n            <h3 id="mozTocId586677"> \xe2\x80\x9cFit &amp; Proper\xe2\x80\x9d requirements for significant \r\n              owners, directors and senior officers of FRFIs </h3>\r\n            <p> The FATF Recommendations include measures to mitigate the risk \r\n              that criminals and other inappropriate persons might take over ownership \r\n              of, or unduly influence the management of, financial institutions. \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p> OSFI screens all persons who own or control, directly or indirectly, \r\n              significant interests in FRFIs. This screening is done prior to \r\n              the approval of a new FRFI and when ownership interests change. \r\n              In addition, OSFI screens directors and senior officers who will \r\n              be in place when a FRFI commences operations.

These outcomes are set \r\n              out as regulatory requirements which, in the aggregate, form the \r\n              compliance regime to be embedded in FRFIs\xe2\x80\x99 AML/ATF programs. Examples \r\n              of regulatory requirements include: the identification of clients; \r\n              the appointment of a CAMLO; determining whether a client is a PEFP; \r\n              the prohibition on dealing with shell banks. Some requirements feed \r\n              into broader outcomes; others are themselves outcomes. </p>\r\n            <p> In all cases, the manner in which these outcomes may be achieved \r\n              is prescribed. Generally, there are three ways in which the PCMLTFA \r\n              and the Regulations prescribe how an outcome is to be achieved: \r\n            </p>\r\n            <ul class="list-bullet-none">\r\n              <li>1. By one or more Prescriptive Measures</li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n            <p> In these situations, one or more measures are prescribed. All \r\n              of the prescribed measures must be followed. An example is PEFP \r\n              determination - if a client is determined to be a PEFP, certain \r\n              prescribed measures must be taken. </p>\r\n            <ul class="list-bullet-none">\r\n              <li>2. By a choice of Prescriptive Measures </li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n            <p> In these situations, a choice of alternative measures is prescribed. \r\n              These measures offer FRFIs flexibility in achieving the prescribed \r\n              outcome. Aside from selecting which option to choose, no other options \r\n              or alternatives are available to the FRFI. Examples include prescribed \r\n              types of acceptable identification documentation for individuals \r\n              and prescribed sets of alternative measures for the identification \r\n              of credit card clients in non-face-to face situations. </p>\r\n            <ul class="list-bullet-none">\r\n              <li>3. By Reasonable measures </li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n            <p> In these situations, the PCMLTFA and PCMLTFR allow FRFIs more \r\n              flexibility to determine for themselves how to achieve the prescribed \r\n              outcomes, provided that the measures chosen are \xe2\x80\x9creasonable\xe2\x80\x9d. To \r\n              be reasonable, the measures used must achieve the prescribed outcome. \r\n              An example is reasonable measures to determine the source of funds \r\n              for certain high risk clients. </p>\r\n            <p> This Guideline identifies measures that OSFI has found to be reasonable \r\n              when applied effectively \xe2\x80\x93 i.e., when they achieve prescribed outcomes. \r\n              The measures, which are drawn from a wide base of sources, including \r\n              the FATF, should not be treated as checklists<em>.</em> </p>\r\n            <p> As noted below, OSFI expects FRFIs to have AML/ATF programs in \r\n              place that include measures which are not expressly addressed by \r\n              the PCMLTFA and PCMLTFR, but which are consistent with other OSFI \r\n              Guidance and OSFI\xe2\x80\x99s Supervisory Framework.

The questions could be expanded \r\n              to cover family members with any similar connections. If the responses \r\n              are not clear or inconclusive, additional assessment or due diligence \r\n              may be necessary before finalizing the determination.

FRFIs should ensure \r\n              that where agents or mandataries are responsible for gathering the \r\n              information, the agents understand what is required to be done and \r\n              the FRFI satisfies itself that its agents are doing what is required. \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p> If a client\xe2\x80\x99s name is contained in a public database, but the \r\n              FRFI does not determine the client is a PEFP, the FRFI may wish \r\n              to make a note of the \xe2\x80\x9chit\xe2\x80\x9d for future reference or to guide it \r\n              in any future risk assessment. </p>\r\n            <h4> What Happens after a PEFP Determination is made </h4>\r\n            <p> Once a PEFP determination is made, it may not be reversed or otherwise \r\n              changed, other than to correct error.

Examples \r\n              of source of funds could include: savings accumulated through employment; \r\n              sale of investments; sale of a business; an inheritance; a salary \r\n              bonus; and consulting fees. </p>\r\n            <p> In respect of the approval by a senior officer, such individual \r\n              should be a person at a more senior level who has the authority \r\n              to make this decision. </p>\r\n            <p> Reasonable measures for enhanced and ongoing monitoring of PEFPs\xe2\x80\x99 \r\n              accounts may involve manual or automated processes, or a combination \r\n              of both depending on resources and needs and could include: </p>\r\n            <ul>\r\n              <li> Developing reports or performing more frequent review of PEFP \r\n                account activity, and flagging activities that deviate from expectations \r\n                and elevate concerns as necessary; </li>\r\n              <li> Setting up a management committee to regularly review all identified \r\n                PEFPs and their transactions; and </li>\r\n              <li> Reviewing transactions more frequently against indicators of \r\n                suspicious transactions. </li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n            <h4> PEFPs in Canada and Domestic PEPs </h4>\r\n            <p> The PEFP definition in the PCMLTFA indicates that the country \r\n              of residence or citizenship of an individual is immaterial to PEFP \r\n              determination. FRFIs should therefore ensure that their methodology \r\n              of PEFP determination does not preclude individuals merely because \r\n              they may be Canadian citizens or residents. </p>\r\n            <p> FRFIs may need to ensure they distinguish between PEFPs and domestic \r\n              PEPs. The latter are not separately defined in the PCMLTFA definition \r\n              of PEFP, although a PEFP could also be a domestic PEP. However, \r\n              FRFIs are not under any legal obligation to identify domestic PEPs \r\n              <em>per se</em>, whether by screening or flagging large transactions \r\n              or in any other way. Further, even if FRFIs know they are dealing \r\n              with a domestic PEP, they are not under any legal obligation to \r\n              apply the measures that are applicable to PEFP accounts, unless \r\n              that individual is a PEFP. </p>\r\n            <p> Where a FRFI is aware that a client is a domestic PEP, the FRFI \r\n              should assess what effect, if any, this may have on the overall \r\n              assessed risk of the client. If the assessed risk is elevated, the \r\n              FRFI should apply enhanced due diligence measures as it considers \r\n              appropriate. </p>\r\n            <h4> Identification of PEFPs in Foreign Subsidiaries or Branches </h4>\r\n            <p> The PCMLTFA and PCMLTFR do not oblige FRFIs to apply PEFP measures \r\n              to their subsidiaries or branches of FRFIs outside Canada. </p>\r\n            <p> Where a FRFI is aware that a client of a subsidiary or a branch \r\n              outside Canada is a PEFP, the FRFI should assess what effect, if \r\n              any, this may have on the overall assessed risk of the client. If \r\n              the assessed risk is elevated, the FRFI should apply enhanced due \r\n              diligence as it considers appropriate. </p>\r\n            <p> The operations of foreign branches and subsidiaries may be subject \r\n              to local AML/ATF legislation, which may include requirements to \r\n              identify and monitor PEPs, including PEFPs. </p>\r\n            <h4>Identification of PEFPs who own or control 25% or more of Clients \r\n              that are Corporations or Entities, or who are directors or officers \r\n              of such corporations or entities </h4>\r\n            <p> FRFIs are not obliged by the PCMLTFA or PCMLTFR to apply PEFP \r\n              determination procedures to persons who own or control 25% or more \r\n              of clients that are corporations or entities, or who are directors \r\n              or officers of such corporations or entities. </p>\r\n            <p> Where a FRFI is aware that a person who owns or controls 25% or \r\n              more of a client that is a corporation or entity, or who is a director \r\n              or officer of such a corporation or entity, is a PEFP, the FRFI \r\n              should assess what effect, if any, this may have on the overall \r\n              assessed risk of the client corporation or entity. If the assessed \r\n              risk is elevated, the FRFI should apply enhanced due diligence as \r\n              it considers appropriate.

The key element of the technique \r\n              is the misrepresentation of the price of the good or service in \r\n              order to transfer additional value between the importer and exporter. \r\n              Many such cases have been identified by the FATF. </p>\r\n            <h4> Multiple Invoicing of Goods and Services </h4>\r\n            <p> By invoicing the same good or service more than once, a money \r\n              launderer may be able to justify multiple payments for the same \r\n              shipment of goods or delivery of services, especially if more than \r\n              one financial institution is used.
