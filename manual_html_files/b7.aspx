</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="clear"></div>\r\n<h2 id="toc2">Definition</h2>\r\n<p>Derivatives are financial contracts whose values depend  on, or are derived from, the value of one or more underlying reference assets.\xc2\xa0 The value can be determined by fluctuations  of the underlying asset, which may include stocks, bonds, commodities,  currencies, interest rates and market indices. \xc2\xa0Derivatives include a wide assortment of  financial contracts, including forwards, futures, swaps and options. \xc2\xa0An over-the-counter (OTC) derivative is a  bi-lateral contract, negotiated between two parties, that does not go through  an exchange. \xc2\xa0An exchange-traded derivative  is a standardized contract that is transacted on an organized exchange.\xc2\xa0 </p>\r\n<h2 id="toc3">Use of  Derivatives</h2>\r\n<p>Derivatives allow FRFIs and other participants  to identify, isolate and manage separately the risks in financial instruments  and commodities for the purpose of trading, hedging, <a href="#Arbitrage">arbitrage</a>, and adjusting portfolio risks. \xc2\xa0</p>\r\n<p>FRFIs may use derivatives as <a href="#Enduser">end-users</a>, <a href="#Activeposition">active  position-takers</a>, and <a href="#Dealer">dealers</a>. \xc2\xa0For example, a FRFI acts as an end-user when  it uses derivatives to take positions as part of its proprietary trading or for  hedging as part of its asset and liability management program.\xc2\xa0 It acts as a dealer when it quotes bids and  offers and commits capital to satisfying customers\' demands for derivatives.\xc2\xa0 </p>\r\n<p>The Canadian derivatives market is dominated by FRFIs  including the five largest banks for which derivatives activities represent a  core business overseen by OSFI as part of its prudential mandate. \xc2\xa0For that reason, the Guideline may contain  bank-specific references.\xc2\xa0 Banks will  also be required to comply with any regulations made under the <em>Bank Act</em> <sup id="fnb1-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb1"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>1</a></sup> respecting their activities in relation to derivatives. </p>\r\n<h2 id="toc4">Risks of  Derivatives</h2>\r\n<p>The key risks associated with derivatives include  market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.\xc2\xa0  The risks of derivatives are more directly related to size and price  volatility (including valuation adjustments) of the cash flows they represent  than they are to the size of the notional amounts on which the cash flows are  based. \xc2\xa0In fact, the risks of  derivatives, and the cash flows that are derived from them, may represent only  a small portion of the notional amounts.\xc2\xa0  However, in other cases (e.g., <a href="#CDS">credit default swaps</a>) the entire notional amount may represent potential  cash flows. </p>\r\n<h2 id="toc5">Risk Management</h2>\r\n<p>The process of risk management for derivatives should  be integrated into the FRFI\xe2\x80\x99s overall risk management program.<strong>\xc2\xa0 </strong>FRFIs  should be in a position to identify the material risks they face with respect  to derivatives activities, assess their potential impact and have policies and  controls in place to manage risk effectively. \xc2\xa0A FRFI\xe2\x80\x99s derivatives activities should, consistent  with the <a href="#RAF">Risk Appetite Framework</a><sup id="fnb2-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb2"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>2</a></sup>, be subject to risk limits approved by the Board of  Directors (Board).\xc2\xa0 Effective control,  monitoring and reporting systems and procedures should be in place to ensure  on-going operational compliance with the Risk Appetite Framework.\xc2\xa0 <strong></strong></p>\r\n<p>FRFIs should have a strong governance process around the  valuation of derivatives, which includes robust control processes and documented  procedures.\xc2\xa0 The valuation governance  structures and related processes should be integrated with other risk  management systems within the FRFI.\xc2\xa0 There  should be an appropriate segregation of duties between the valuation function  and trading function based on the FRFI\xe2\x80\x99s derivatives activities.\xc2\xa0 Where  valuation systems are automated, there should be appropriate access management  controls in place.</p>\r\n<p>FRFIs using derivatives instruments where material valuation  uncertainty exists (e.g., instruments with complex payoffs, thinly traded or less  liquid instruments where there are no readily available market prices) should have  valuation and risk management processes that explicitly assess valuation  uncertainty commensurate with the size and depth of its activities. \xc2\xa0Such assessments should be included in  communication to senior management and/or the Board, in their respective roles.</p>\r\n<h2 id="toc6">Market Risk</h2>\r\n<p>The market risk of a derivative is the risk of losses arising from fluctuations in the market value of the underlying reference asset.  Market prices can be influenced by many factors, including movements in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices, exchange rates or commodity prices.  A FRFI should define market risk limits for derivatives exposures based on its overall risk appetite. </p>\r\n<p>A FRFI should identify the market risk drivers for its  derivatives activities, and estimate the market risk to which it is  exposed.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 While there are various  techniques for measuring market risk, the sophistication of a FRFI\xe2\x80\x99s analytical  approach to measuring risk should match the depth of its involvement in the  derivatives market and the complexity of its positions. \xc2\xa0A FRFI whose derivatives activities are  limited in volume and confined to hedging risk as an end-user may need less  sophisticated risk measurement systems than those required by a dealer or  active position-taker. \xc2\xa0For example, use  of complex options requires sophisticated and more  frequent risk monitoring and control than does the use of simpler derivatives  with more <a href="#Symmetric">symmetric payoffs</a> and unleveraged payoffs, e.g., foreign exchange  forwards and futures contracts.\xc2\xa0 </p>\r\n<h3 id="toc6.1">Measurement  of Market Risk</h3>\r\n<p>The appropriateness and adequacy of the assumptions  and parameters that underpin a FRFI\xe2\x80\x99s techniques for measuring market risk  should be fully documented and frequently reviewed against actual experience  and updated market information, particularly in the presence of increased  market volatility. </p>\r\n<p>At a minimum, risk measurement systems of end-users, active  position-takers, and dealers should evaluate the possible impact on the FRFI\xe2\x80\x99s earnings  and capital which may result from adverse changes in interest rates, exchange  rates, and other relevant risk factors in normal and stress environments.</p>\r\n<h3 id="toc6.2">Dealers and  Active Position-takers</h3>\r\n<p>For dealers and active position-takers, market risk is  typically measured as some form of &quot;value at risk&quot; (VaR) or Expected  Shortfall<sup id="fnb3-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb3"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>3</a></sup> based upon an appropriate confidence interval and time  horizon. \xc2\xa0For example, such a measure  could indicate with a 99% confidence that the change in the value of a  portfolio would not exceed a specified amount over any given two week holding  period.</p>\r\n<p>Where measures of value at risk are not explicitly  adjusted for probability (e.g., interest rate sensitive trading portfolios that  are re-valued assuming a fixed basis point change in interest rates),  management should nevertheless document implicit assumptions the measure makes  about volatility in comparison to historical experience.</p>\r\n<p>The internal risk measurement model should exhibit the following  characteristics:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>Provide figures  that are translatable into risk measures in dollar terms:\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li>For <a href="#Linearderivative">linear  derivatives</a> positions, valuation should  use a discounted cash flow (DCF) algorithm to determine the net present value of  positions and/or cash flows. \xc2\xa0Linear positions comprise forwards, swaps,  futures, forward rate agreements, etc., with underlying references such as  money market products, fixed income securities, foreign exchange, equities and  commodities.</li>\r\n      <li>For <a href="#NonLinearderivative">non-linear derivatives</a> positions, valuation should use an appropriate  pricing model to calculate market values of options positions and other contingent  cash flows. \xc2\xa0Non-linear derivatives  positions comprise all option-based products but might arise in other  non-options products due to structural features (e.g., termination or break  clauses).</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>Calculate risk measures in dollar terms from  committed cash flows reflecting volatility of relevant risk factors based on:\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li>appropriate  minimum holding period(s) consistent with the liquidity of the relevant OTC  market needed to hedge any open derivative position;</li>\r\n      <li>a sufficiently  long series of historical data, including a period of stress<sup id="fnb4-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb4"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>4</a></sup>; and</li>\r\n      <li>a minimum level  of probability (e.g., 99 times out of 100).</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>For the purpose  of determining amounts at risk, the required output of a valuation model should  include changes in the derivative\xe2\x80\x99s value based on:\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li>changes in the  price or rate of the underlying position (<a href="#Delta">delta</a>);</li>\r\n      <li>changes in the  rate of change in the price of the underlying position (<a href="#Gamma">gamma</a>);</li>\r\n      <li>changes in  volatility (<a href="#Vega">vega</a>, if  applicable)<sup id="fnb5-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb5"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>5</a></sup>; </li>\r\n      <li>changes to interest rates (rho, if  applicable); and</li>\r\n      <li>time decay (<a href="#Theta">theta</a>, if applicable).</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <p>Examples of risk factors to be considered include:</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li>the risks of  loss arising from changes in the level of interest rates as well as the slope  of the yield curve; and</li>\r\n      <li>where relevant, <a href="#Basis">basis risk</a>, including the risk of loss arising from the degree  to which changes in market rates for different instruments, including different  underlying and different references curves, of possibly the same term are not  perfectly correlated.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>Valuation and  estimation of amounts at risk should be available on a daily basis.</li>\r\n  <li>FRFIs should  have the capacity to frequently update underlying assumptions and the  historical data on which they are based in order to facilitate the periodic  reviews of related policies by senior management and the Board.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The last of these characteristics is particularly  important for the complex mathematical models that are sometimes used by  dealers to identify and aggregate risk. \xc2\xa0These  models can have intrinsic shortcomings that include assumptions about  statistical &quot;normality&quot;, correlations between risks and between  markets and about the liquidity of OTC markets that may not  continue to be valid as markets change and develop.\xc2\xa0 Periodic reviews and appropriate stress tests  help address these concerns. \xc2\xa0</p>\r\n<h3 id="toc6.3">Frequency and  Reporting of Measurement</h3>\r\n<p>The frequency with which exposures should be evaluated  and reported varies according to the nature and size of a FRFI\xe2\x80\x99s involvement,  and should be commensurate with the price volatility, time-horizon and turnover  of the instruments and portfolios being measured. Dealers  and active position-takers should complete more sophisticated and frequent  evaluations and reporting than an end-user who uses derivatives used to hedge  positions in the structural and investment portfolio of the FRFI.\xc2\xa0 Less frequent evaluations may be sufficient for  such a FRFI given the low turnover of the book and its emphasis on effectiveness  in hedging the longer term profile of the more static investment portfolio. \xc2\xa0The frequency of reporting should be increased  as system capabilities are developed and ad-hoc reporting should be executed  during times of unusually high volatility and extraordinary circumstances. <strong> </strong></p>\r\n<h3 id="toc6.4">Valuation Adjustments </h3>\r\n<p>FRFIs should take  into account all relevant valuation adjustments when pricing derivatives.</p>\r\n<h2 id="toc7">Credit Risk</h2>\r\n<p><a href="#CCR">Counterparty credit risk</a> management for derivatives activities should be incorporated into the prudent  person approach<sup id="fnb6-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb6"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>6</a></sup> for  lending. Timely, meaningful reports should be  prescribed and prepared in accordance with policy and procedure requirements,  as established by the FRFI. </p>\r\n<p>FRFIs should have an enterprise-wide credit risk  management function that is independent of individuals and units that conduct  trades and create risk exposures. \xc2\xa0The  credit risk management function should have analytical capabilities commensurate  with the complexity and sophistication of the FRFI\xe2\x80\x99s derivatives activities,  and have clear authority and responsibilities that include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>approving counterparty  credit exposure measurement standards;</li>\r\n  <li>assigning and  approving internal credit risk ratings at inception;</li>\r\n  <li>assessing  periodic reviews of existing counterparties to verify internal credit ratings;</li>\r\n  <li>assigning and  approving counterparty limits;</li>\r\n  <li>monitoring usage  against counterparty limits and taking action to resolve situations where  limits are exceeded;</li>\r\n  <li>approving exceptions to non-standard  credit-related ISDA terms;</li>\r\n  <li>reviewing  concentrations of credit risk; and</li>\r\n  <li>reviewing and  monitoring risk reduction arrangements (e.g., performing ongoing review and  ensuring the enforceability of \xc2\xa0netting arrangements).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>For end-users, these functions may be embedded into an  enterprise-wide credit risk management framework.\xc2\xa0 </p>\r\n<h3 id="toc7.1">Credit Exposure Limits</h3>\r\n<p>A  FRFI should establish written limits regarding counterparty exposures for  derivatives trading and settlement that are consistent with the FRFI\xe2\x80\x99s risk  appetite as well as the risk profile of the counterparty with whom they are  trading.\xc2\xa0 The  criteria that counterparties must meet should be explicitly outlined in the FRFI\xe2\x80\x99s  credit risk policies.\xc2\xa0  Individual counterparty limits should be established by the credit risk  management function, or equivalent.\xc2\xa0 Business with a counterparty should not commence until  a credit exposure limit has been formally established and authorized.\xc2\xa0</p>\r\n<p>Credit authorizations should be provided by personnel  who are independent of personnel responsible for engaging in derivatives  trades.</p>\r\n<h3 id="toc7.2">Measurement  of Credit Risk Exposure</h3>\r\n<p>Prior to settlement, the <a href="#CRE">credit risk exposure</a> of a derivative is measured as the sum of its replacement cost (or current exposure)  and an estimate of the FRFI\xe2\x80\x99s potential future exposure. Replacement  cost is the cost of replacing the remaining cash flows of a derivative at  prevailing market prices. \xc2\xa0Potential  future exposure is a statistically-based estimate of the potential change in  the value over the remaining life of the contract and is primarily a function  of the time remaining to maturity and the expected volatility of the price,  rate or index underlying the derivative.</p>\r\n<p>The method used to measure counterparty credit risk  exposure should be commensurate with the volume and level of complexity of the  derivatives activity. \xc2\xa0Dealers and active  position-takers should have access to credit equivalent exposures, which  represent the replacement cost plus potential future exposure.\xc2\xa0 Counterparty limits should be based on a <a href="#Peakexposure">peak  exposure</a> measure over the life of  the netting sets, rather than the calculation of effective expected positive  exposure (which is used for capitalizing portfolios). \xc2\xa0The replacement cost calculation involves  marking-to-market each derivatives contract.</p>\r\n<p>For dealers and active position-takers, the potential  future exposure calculation should reflect the volatility and remaining  maturity of the derivative position based on:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>an exposure  measure that is based on a distribution of exposures that accounts for the possible  non-normality of the distribution of exposures; </li>\r\n  <li>a sufficiently  long series of historical data, including a period of stress;</li>\r\n  <li>a methodology  that takes into account wrong-way risk; and</li>\r\n  <li>where  appropriate, a methodology that takes into account enforceable netting and  margin/collateral arrangements. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>End-users may elect to use a less sophisticated method  for measuring the potential future exposure (e.g., a look-up table of percentages  of notional value that varies with the volatility and the remaining maturity of  the underlying), as long as other mitigating factors are in place.\xc2\xa0 Examples of mitigating factors include  restricting transactions to the highest quality counterparties or limiting  contracts to mature, less volatile, derivatives.</p>\r\n<p>Senior management should be provided with reports that  document credit risk exposure by, for example, counterparty geography/currency,  or any other relevant units of netting and aggregation.\xc2\xa0 Such reports should include the credit risk exposures  of derivatives with all other credit risk exposures the FRFI might have to a  particular customer.</p>\r\n<h3 id="toc7.3">Netting</h3>\r\n<p>In order to reduce counterparty credit risk exposure,  a FRFI should, where practicable, use legally enforceable bi-lateral and  multi-lateral netting agreements with its counterparties. \xc2\xa0FRFIs should  control and monitor their derivatives\' credit exposures on a net basis only when  they have performed sufficient legal review (e.g., obtaining a legal opinion)  to ensure the enforceability of close-out netting arrangements with counterparties  under the laws of all of the relevant jurisdictions. \xc2\xa0Legal enforceability should extend to any  relevant insolvency proceedings of the counterparty. \xc2\xa0The FRFI should be able to demonstrate that it  has exercised due diligence in evaluating the enforceability of these contracts.</p>\r\n<h3 id="toc7.4">Margining</h3>\r\n<p>To mitigate replacement cost risk, a FRFI can  choose to exchange (i.e., both receive and deliver) <a href="#Variationmargin">variation margin</a> to collateralise changes in mark-to-market  exposure. \xc2\xa0The frequency with which variation  margin is exchanged should affect the determination of the size of minimum  transfer amounts with the most frequent exchanges (i.e. daily) corresponding to  the lowest minimum transfer amounts.</p>\r\n<p>Where a FRFI has chosen to adopt an exchange  of variation margin, it should use legally enforceable collateral arrangements,  such as a <a href="#Creditsupport">credit support annex</a> (CSA).\xc2\xa0  These arrangements should include, among other things, details on  eligible collateral, applicable haircuts, frequency of variation margin  exchanges, thresholds and minimum transfer amounts. \xc2\xa0The FRFI should  be able to demonstrate that it, or a qualified third party, has performed  sufficient legal review in evaluating the enforceability of these contracts  (e.g., obtaining updated enforceability opinions).</p>\r\n<p>FRFIs should ensure that  any collateral received, after accounting for an appropriate haircut, is able  to hold its value in a time of financial stress. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To the extent that the  value of the collateral is exposed to liquidity credit, market and  foreign exchange risks in stressed market conditions, increasingly conservative  risk-sensitive haircuts should be applied.</p>\r\n<h3 id="toc7.5">Settlement  Risk</h3>\r\n<p>Settlement risk is the risk an institution faces when  it has performed its obligations under a contract, but has not yet received  value from its counterparty.\xc2\xa0 This risk  arises if the counterparty defaults during the settlement cycle for operational  or other reasons.\xc2\xa0 FRFIs should establish limits and monitoring  procedures for settlement risk exposures.\xc2\xa0 In  the case of FRFIs that are branch operations, the limits and procedures within  the branch operations should be integrated with those used in the home  jurisdiction.\xc2\xa0 </p>\r\n<h3 id="toc7.6">Central  Counterparties (CCPs)</h3>\r\n<p>A CCP is an entity that interposes itself between  counterparties to contracts in a financial market, becoming the buyer to every  seller and the seller to every buyer.\xc2\xa0  This allows the CCP to assume counterparty risk while market  participants retain market exposures. \xc2\xa0A  CCP becomes a counterparty to trades with market participants through novation,  an open offer system, or another legally binding arrangement.\xc2\xa0 Among other measures, CCPs mitigate risk  through the use of margin requirements (both

should result  in more effective management of counterparty credit risk, improve market transparency  and mitigate systemic risk.\xc2\xa0 </p>\r\n<p>A FRFI should establish internal credit risk ratings  and counterparty credit limits for CCPs on a risk-adjusted basis consistent  with its risk appetite and counterparty credit risk policies. </p>\r\n<h3 id="toc7.7">Qualifying  Central Counterparties (QCCPs)</h3>\r\n<p>In order to be classified as a <a href="#QCCP">QCCP</a>, a CCP must be based, and prudentially  supervised, in a jurisdiction where the relevant regulator/overseer has  established, and publicly indicated that it applies to the CCP on an on-going  basis, domestic rules and regulations that are consistent with the CPSS-IOSCO <a href="http://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD350.pdf" rel="external">Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures</a> (PFMIs).\xc2\xa0 </p>\r\n<h3 id="toc7.8">Capital Incentives for Central Clearing </h3>\r\n<p>In order to encourage central clearing of  standardized derivatives, on January 1, 2013, OSFI implemented capital incentives  for  central   clearing of derivatives  and  appropriate  capitalization   of bi-lateral transactions with the adoption of Basel III minimum  capital requirements in the Capital Adequacy Requirements (CAR) guideline.\xc2\xa0 These rules provide clear  incentives to centrally clear derivatives by recognizing, through reduced  capital requirements, the lower risks associated with multilateral netting of exposures  under various models of central  clearing.\xc2\xa0 The rules also increase  capital requirements for large interbank exposures and bank exposures to highly  levered counterparties in the OTC derivatives markets through the advanced  approaches to credit risk.\xc2\xa0 In addition, the Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA)  capital charge for bilateral OTC derivatives<sup id="fnb7-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb7"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>7</a></sup> went into effect on January 1, 2014.</p>\r\n<h3 id="toc7.9">Central  Clearing by FRFIs</h3>\r\n<p>All central clearing by FRFIs  should be done using a QCCP, including global QCCPs, recognized by Canadian  authorities<sup id="fnb8-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb8"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>8</a></sup>. If no QCCP recognized by Canadian authorities  is available, FRFIs should use a CCP that is recognized as a QCCP in a foreign  jurisdiction. \xc2\xa0</p>\r\n<p>OSFI,  as the primary regulator for FRFIs, expects a FRFI to centrally clear, where practicable, new <a href="#Standardizedderivative">standardized derivatives</a> in which it is transacting where the clearing of such products is offered by a  QCCP.\xc2\xa0 OSFI expects that the availability  of central clearing will increase over time as more products are standardized  and QCCPs expand clearing capacity. \xc2\xa0</p>\r\n<p>QCCPs  have access and participation requirements to help ensure that only entities with  the ability to manage risks in the clearing system become <a href="#Clearingmember">clearing members</a>.\xc2\xa0 Direct participation may be limited to  members with adequate financial and technical resources to assist in managing  the default of a member.\xc2\xa0 For FRFIs that are not direct  clearing members, indirect clearing may be available as an  alternative means of accessing central clearing, whereby the FRFI would clear  indirectly as a <a href="#Client">client</a> of a direct clearing member. \xc2\xa0</p>\r\n<p>FRFIs  using a QCCP should follow the membership rules and regulations imposed by the QCCP and its  applicable regulator(s).\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 </p>\r\n<p>Intra-group transactions between a FRFI and its  affiliates are not expected to be centrally cleared, provided the risks of the  transactions are measured, monitored, and controlled as part of the FRFI\xe2\x80\x99s risk management framework.\xc2\xa0 </p>\r\n<h2 id="toc8">Liquidity Risk</h2>\r\n<h3 id="toc8.1"><a href="#MLR">Market Liquidity Risk</a></h3>\r\n<p>During periods of market stress, market liquidity can  evaporate and place a significant downward pressure on the market value of  instruments.\xc2\xa0 A FRFI   should take account of the risks of sudden changes in market liquidity, which  can alter the effectiveness of hedging strategies. In  designing stress scenarios, a FRFI   should consider the nature of  its  activities and vulnerabilities to ensure that the scenarios incorporate  the major market liquidity risks to which the FRFI is exposed. </p>\r\n<p>When a FRFI establishes its market risk exposure  limits, it should consider how long it would take to unwind or offset a  position.\xc2\xa0 Where markets or products are  illiquid and there is little variety or depth to hedging alternatives, the FRFI  should assume longer holding periods in measuring market risk. </p>\r\n<h3 id="toc8.2">Collateral  Management</h3>\r\n<p>As FRFIs increase their use of CCPs for standardized  derivatives, the importance of effective collateral management will increase because  clearing members must post initial and variation margin.\xc2\xa0 </p>\r\n<p>In future, FRFIs may  be required to obtain and deploy additional liquidity resources to meet margin  requirements that exceed current practice.\xc2\xa0  A FRFI should actively manage its collateral positions, and ensure that  its liquidity needs and risks associated with its derivatives activities are  appropriately represented in its overall liquidity risk management  framework.\xc2\xa0 A FRFI should incorporate cash flows related to the re-pricing,  exercise or maturity of derivatives contracts in its liquidity risk analysis  based on the materiality of the liquidity risk exposures these activities  create.\xc2\xa0This includes the potential for counterparties  to demand additional collateral in the event of, for example, a decline in the FRFI\xe2\x80\x99s  credit rating or creditworthiness and/or a decline in the price of the  underlying asset.</p>\r\n<h2 id="toc9">Operational  Risk</h2>\r\n<p>The effective management of <a href="#Operational">operational risk</a> is a fundamental element of a FRFI\xe2\x80\x99s risk  management program. \xc2\xa0Operational risk is  inherent in all financial products, activities, processes and systems,  including those related to derivatives. \xc2\xa0The  structure of the relevant operational risk management framework will depend on  the FRFI\xe2\x80\x99s nature, size, and complexity, and risk profile of its activities.\xc2\xa0If derivatives products, activities, processes or  systems are material to the FRFI, the inherent operational risk should be identified, assessed and understood as part of the operational  risk management framework, and appropriate monitoring and  reporting mechanisms should be in place to support the proactive control and  mitigation of risk.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\r\n<h3 id="toc9.1">Legal Risk </h3>\r\n<p>FRFIs are expected to take necessary steps to mitigate <a href="#Legal">legal  risk</a>.\xc2\xa0 For example,  prior to engaging in derivatives transactions, a FRFI should satisfy itself  that its counterparties have the legal authority to engage in those  transactions.\xc2\xa0 Where agents are involved,  a FRFI should take all reasonable steps to assure itself that the necessary  legal authorities exist.\xc2\xa0 </p>\r\n<p>A FRFI should satisfy itself that the terms of any contract  governing its derivatives activities are legally sound and the underlying transaction  documentation is adequate.\xc2\xa0 This is  especially important with respect to provisions governing, 1) the timing of the  termination of outstanding transactions and, 2) the calculation of settlement  amounts payable to or between parties upon the termination of a transaction or  an agreement. In order to promote legal certainty, FRFIs should seek to agree  in writing with counterparties to all material terms governing their trading  relationship prior to or at the time of execution of a non-centrally cleared  derivative.\xc2\xa0 </p>\r\n<p>A FRFI should act honestly and in good faith when  marketing, negotiating, entering into, executing and administering transactions  with its clients or counterparties.\xc2\xa0  Staff who are involved in trading or providing advice in relation to  derivatives trades should have the appropriate education, skills, experience  and training to carry out their responsibilities.\xc2\xa0 FRFIs dealing in derivatives should also take  reasonable steps to identify and address potential material conflicts of  interest.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 </p>\r\n<h3 id="toc9.2">Regulatory  Compliance Risk</h3>\r\n<p>Given the global nature of derivatives markets, a FRFI  should have procedures for identifying, risk assessing, communicating, managing  and mitigating <a href="#Regulatory">regulatory compliance risk</a>.\xc2\xa0 A FRFI should  maintain knowledge of <a href="#Regrequirements">regulatory requirements</a> of all jurisdictions which may apply to its  derivatives activities.\xc2\xa0 Non-compliance  with applicable regulatory requirements can have significant negative effects  on a FRFI\xe2\x80\x99s reputation and/or safety and soundness and may lead to increased  regulatory intervention.\xc2\xa0 </p>\r\n<h3 id="toc9.3">Business Resiliency and Continuity</h3>\r\n<p>FRFIs  should have business resiliency and continuity plans in place to ensure their  ability to operate on an ongoing basis and limit losses in the event of a severe  business disruption commensurate with the nature, size  and complexity of their operations. \xc2\xa0Continuity  management should incorporate business impact analysis, recovery strategies,  testing, training and awareness programs, and communication and crisis  management programs.</p>\r\n<p>FRFIs  should consider derivatives activities when identifying critical business  operations, key internal and external dependencies, and appropriate resilience  levels.\xc2\xa0 Depending on the nature,  size, and complexity of the derivatives activities, plausible disruptive  scenarios should be assessed for their financial, operational and reputational  impact, and the resulting risk assessment should be the foundation for recovery  priorities and objectives. </p>\r\n<h2 id="toc10">Stress Testing </h2>\r\n<p>Stress testing<sup id="fnb9-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb9"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>9</a></sup> is a risk management technique used to  evaluate the potential effects on a FRFI\xe2\x80\x99s financial condition, of a set of  specified changes in risk factors, corresponding to exceptional but plausible  events.\xc2\xa0 It attempts to determine the  impact of situations where the assumptions underlying established models used  in managing a business break down.\xc2\xa0 Stress  testing should play an important role in facilitating the development of risk  mitigation or contingency plans across a range of stress conditions, and should  support the FRFI\xe2\x80\x99s decision making process.\xc2\xa0  The sophistication of a FRFI\xe2\x80\x99s stress testing with respect to  derivatives activities should be commensurate with the nature, size and  complexity of its involvement.</p>\r\n<p>Stress tests help detect vulnerabilities including  unidentified risk concentrations or potential interactions between types of  risks.\xc2\xa0 They should include both  historical events and the simulation of shocks that have not previously  occurred, covering a range of risks and business areas.\xc2\xa0 FRFIs may have large gross exposures to  derivatives counterparties that may be particularly exposed to specific assets  types and market movements.\xc2\xa0 In the case  of severe market shocks, these exposures may increase abruptly.\xc2\xa0 The potential correlation of the probability  of default of counterparties with market risk factors may emerge (i.e., wrong-way  risk).\xc2\xa0 Depending on the nature, size and  complexity of its involvement in derivatives, a FRFI should ensure scenarios  incorporate both <a href="#CCR">counterparty credit risk</a> and market risk, understanding the impact on  collateral requirements during times of market stress.\xc2\xa0 Senior management should ensure the stress  tests are well-understood, documented, and sufficiently severe relative to the FRFI  and the complexity of its derivatives activities. </p>\r\n<p>Stress scenarios should include abnormally large  market swings and periods of prolonged inactivity.\xc2\xa0 If appropriate, the tests should consider the effect of price  changes on the close-out value of the portfolio, as well as changes in the  assumptions about the adjustments to the close-out price (such as the impact  that decreased liquidity would have on close-out costs).\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In addition to directional stress tests  which impact the value of primary underlying risk factors, FRFIs should  consider additional non-directional stresses (such as the breakdown in  historically stable correlation relationships) as well as the use of <a href="#Reversestress">reverse  stress tests</a> to, for  example, manage market risk factor concentrations. </p>\r\n<h2 id="toc11">System Infrastructure Considerations </h2>\r\n<p>A FRFI  should ensure that its systems infrastructure keeps up with changes in the size  and complexity of its derivatives activities and the derivatives markets in general.  \xc2\xa0FRFIs should have a sound technology  infrastructure that meets current and long-term business requirements as well  as integrated and comprehensive risk management.\xc2\xa0 A FRFI should ensure its derivatives systems  have sufficient capacity and are designed appropriately for the scale of its  current and expected derivatives activity.\xc2\xa0 </p>\r\n<h3 id="toc11.1">Trade Confirmation</h3>\r\n<p>A  FRFI should establish and implement processes and procedures that allow it to confirm  the material terms of bilateral derivatives transactions in a timely manner  after execution to reduce the potential for losses from market risk or other  sources. \xc2\xa0Where practicable based on the  nature, size and complexity of the FRFI and its derivatives activities, electronic  methods and standard settlement instructions should be used to maximize the use  of straight through processing (STP) and allow for prompt <a href="#Confirmation">confirmation and affirmation</a>.  \xc2\xa0STP helps to ensure that data is  disseminated quickly, accurately and efficiently throughout the FRFI, and  allows for effective monitoring and control of risks from trade execution to  settlement.\xc2\xa0Escalation procedures  should be in place to seek to resolve unconfirmed transactions in a timely  manner.\xc2\xa0 As the confirmation and  affirmation processes are critical controls, there  should be an appropriate segregation of duties between these functions and the trading function.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 id="toc11.2">Portfolio Reconciliation</h3>\r\n<p>A FRFI should seek to periodically  engage in <a href="#Portfolioreconciliation">portfolio reconciliation</a> of uncleared derivatives  with counterparties with whom it has a material number of derivatives  outstanding in order to identify and facilitate resolution of discrepancies,  particularly with respect to the valuation of OTC derivative transactions.\xc2\xa0 Procedures should be in place in order to  resolve any discrepancies or disputes with respect to material terms and  valuations in a timely manner.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 id="toc11.3">Portfolio Compression</h3>\r\n<p>Portfolio  compression is a post-trade processing and netting mechanism whereby  substantially similar transactions among two or more counterparties are  terminated and replaced with a smaller number of transactions of decreased  notional value.  \xc2\xa0For  portfolios with large numbers of uncleared derivatives contracts containing  substantially similar economic terms, a FRFI should periodically assess the  potential for portfolio compression  and, where appropriate, engage in portfolio compression on a bilateral and  multilateral basis to reduce the risk, cost, and inefficiency of maintaining  redundant transactions on the counterparties\xe2\x80\x99 books. </p>\r\n<h3 id="toc11.4">Electronic Trading Platforms \xc2\xa0</h3>\r\n<p>While  the number of derivatives contracts that are traded on exchanges or other  electronic platforms globally has grown in recent years, the OTC portion of the  market continues to dominate. \xc2\xa0OSFI  expects FRFIs to support efforts to increase the movement of OTC derivatives  trading to organized platforms as the standardization of derivatives increases  and Financial Stability Board (FSB) member  jurisdictions develop guidance regarding the use of electronic  trading platforms.</p>\r\n<h2 id="toc12">Reporting to Trade Repositories</h2>\r\n<h3 id="toc12.1">Objective</h3>\r\n<p>One of the main objectives  of <a href="#Trade">Trade Repository</a> (TR) reporting is to  improve transparency in the derivatives market by improving the availability of  data to authorities in order to fulfill their respective mandates and monitor  financial stability.\xc2\xa0 </p>\r\n<h3 id="toc12.2">Global Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) System</h3>\r\n<p>In  order to facilitate data reporting, the FSB is coordinating the development and  implementation of the global LEI system that will uniquely identify parties to  financial transactions.\xc2\xa0 This initiative  requires strong cooperation between the regulatory community and private sector  stakeholders.\xc2\xa0 OSFI expects that FRFIs will  continue to actively participate in the development and implementation of the  LEI initiative to facilitate trade reporting.\xc2\xa0  They should not only obtain their own LEIs, but encourage their clients  and counterparties to derivatives transactions to obtain a LEI.\xc2\xa0 </p>\r\n<h3 id="toc12.3">Reporting Obligation</h3>\r\n<p>Multiple TRs operate, or  are undergoing approval processes, in a number of different jurisdictions, and  the requirements for trade reporting currently differ across jurisdictions. \xc2\xa0OSFI expects that a FRFI  report derivatives transactions to a recognized TR, following the derivatives  data reporting requirements<sup id="fnb10-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb10"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>10</a></sup> that have been adopted in the province in which  the the head office and/or  principal place of business of the FRFI is located (\xe2\x80\x9clocal reporting  requirements\xe2\x80\x9d). \xc2\xa0A FRFI should  have in place the necessary systems, processes and controls in order to meet  the timing and content of the local reporting  requirements.\xc2\xa0 OSFI will monitor FRFIs\xe2\x80\x99  compliance with this requirement, and a FRFI acting as a dealer should include in its  annual chief compliance officer (CCO) report<sup id="fnb11-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb11"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>11</a></sup> an assessment of its compliance with the local reporting  requirements.</p>\r\n<h3 id="toc12.4">Data Aggregation and Access</h3>\r\n<p>TR data are currently  fragmented across many locations, stored in a variety of formats, and subject  to many different rules for authorities\xe2\x80\x99 access. \xc2\xa0The data in these TRs will need to be  aggregated if authorities are to obtain a comprehensive and accurate view of  the global OTC derivatives markets. \xc2\xa0The  global aggregation of TR data is a particularly complex issue and its  feasibility is currently being analyzed through international work streams. </p>\r\n<p>As FRFIs\xe2\x80\x99 primary  prudential regulatory authority, OSFI continues to closely follow international  developments and work with TRs regarding authorities\xe2\x80\x99 access to data.\xc2\xa0 Although there are a number of issues that  must be resolved before data can be meaningfully used by authorities, including  information gaps, legal obstacles to data access, and technical fragmentation,  OSFI expects to obtain access to TR data submitted by FRFIs.\xc2\xa0 A FRFI should use its best efforts to  facilitate OSFI obtaining access to derivatives data reported to a TR.\xc2\xa0 </p>\r\n<h2 id="toc13">Capital  for Derivatives Transactions</h2>\r\n<p>As is the case with all risk-bearing activities, the risk  exposures a FRFI assumes in its derivatives activities should be fully  supported by capital. \xc2\xa0A FRFI should  ensure that its capital is sufficient to support all quantifiable risks, of  which derivatives are a part, on a consolidated basis and that adequate capital  is maintained in all group entities engaged in these activities. \xc2\xa0Credit, market, and operational risks need to  be identified and incorporated into capital adequacy management. \xc2\xa0 </p>\r\n<p>A FRFI\xe2\x80\x99s analysis of its Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment  Process (ICAAP) or Own Risk Solvency Assessment (ORSA) and stress testing  program should consider the potential for material loss arising from its derivatives  activities.\xc2\xa0 The ICAAP or ORSA should  address all material risks faced by the FRFI, and if appropriate,  derivatives-related risks should be reflected in a FRFI\xe2\x80\x99s internal capital  target. \xc2\xa0</p>\r\n<h2 id="toc14">Other  Guidance</h2>\r\n<p>This Guideline is complementary
