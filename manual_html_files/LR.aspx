</em>(TLCA) and  subsection 409(1) of the Cooperative Credit Associations Act (CCAA) require banks,  bank holding companies, trust and loan companies, and cooperative retail  associations, respectively, to maintain adequate capital. The Leverage  Requirements Guideline is not made pursuant to subsections 485(2) or 949(2) of  the BA, to subsection 473(2) of the TLCA, or to subsection 409(2) of the CCAA.  However, the leverage requirements set out in this guideline, together with the  capital standards specified in the Capital Adequacy Requirements (CAR)  Guideline, provide the framework within which the Superintendent assesses  whether a bank or a trust or loan company maintains adequate capital pursuant  to the Acts. For this purpose, the Superintendent has established two minimum  standards: the leverage ratio described in this Guideline, and the risk-based  capital ratio set out in the CAR Guideline. The first test provides an overall  measure of the adequacy of an institution\'s capital. The second measure focuses  on risk faced by the institution. Notwithstanding that a bank, bank holding  company, a trust and loan company, or cooperative credit association may meet  these standards, the Superintendent may direct a bank or bank holding company  to increase its capital under subsections 485(3) or 949(3) of the BA, a trust and  loan company to increase its capital under subsection 473(3) of the TLCA, or a  cooperative retail association to increase its capital under section 409(3) of  the CCAA. </p>\r\n<p>OSFI, as a member of the Basel Committee on Banking  Supervision, participated in the development of the international leverage  ratio framework, <em>Basel III leverage ratio  framework and disclosure requirements </em>(January 2014).This domestic  guidance is based on the Basel III leverage ratio framework. </p>\r\n<p>Where relevant, the Basel III leverage ratio framework  paragraph numbers are provided in square brackets at the end of each paragraph  referencing material from the Basel III leverage ratio framework. </p>\r\n<div class="module-table-contents">\r\n  <h2>Table of  Contents</h2>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li><a href="#overview">Overview</a> </li>\r\n    <li><a href="#scopapp">Scope of Application</a> </li>\r\n    <li><a href="#cal">Calculation of leverage  requirements</a> </li>\r\n    <li><a href="#mintar">Minimum and authorized leverage requirements</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href="#capmea">Capital Measure</a> </li>\r\n    <li> <a href="#expomea">Exposure Measure</a>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li><a href="#a">(a) On balance sheet  exposures</a> </li>\r\n        <li><a href="#b">(b) Derivative exposures</a>\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li><a href="#bi">(i) Treatment of derivatives</a> </li>\r\n            <li><a href="#bii">(ii) Bilateral netting</a> </li>\r\n            <li><a href="#biii">(iii) Treatment of related collateral</a> </li>\r\n            <li><a href="#biv">(iv) Treatment of cash variation margin</a> </li>\r\n            <li><a href="#bv">(v) Treatment of clearing services</a> </li>\r\n            <li><a href="#bvi">(vi) Additional treatment of written credit  derivatives</a> </li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li> <a href="#c">(c) Securities financing  transaction (SFT) exposures</a>\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li><a href="#ci">(i) General treatment (institution acting  as a principal)</a> </li>\r\n            <li><a href="#cii">(ii) Qualifying master netting agreement</a> </li>\r\n            <li><a href="#ciii">(iii) Sale accounting transactions</a> </li>\r\n            <li><a href="#civ">(iv) Institution acting as an agent  providing an indemnity for credit risk</a> </li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li><a href="#d">(d) Off balance sheet  exposures</a></li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>Outlined below are the leverage requirements for banks, federally regulated trust or  loan companies and cooperative retail associations, and for bank holding  companies incorporated or formed under Part XV of the <em>Bank Act</em>,  collectively referred to as \xe2\x80\x98institutions\xe2\x80\x99.</li>\r\n  <li>Parts of this guideline  are drawn from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) Basel III leverage  ratio framework, entitled: <em>Basel III  leverage ratio framework and disclosure requirements </em>(January 2014) and  the BCBS <em>Frequently asked questions on the Basel III leverage ratio  framework</em> (October 2014).

Therefore, the capital measure used  for the leverage ratio at any particular point in time is the all-in Tier 1  capital measure applying at that time under the risk-based capital framework.\r\n    <p class="align-right">[BCBS Jan 2014 par 10]</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2 id="expomea">Exposure Measure</h2>\r\n<ol start="11">\r\n  <li>The exposure measure  for the leverage ratio should generally follow the accounting value, subject to  the following:\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li>on-balance sheet, non-derivative exposures are included in the  exposure measure net of individual or collective allowances or accounting  valuation adjustments (e.g., accounting credit valuation adjustments); </li>\r\n      <li>netting  of loans and deposits is not allowed.\r\n        <p class="align-right">[BCBS Jan 2014 par 12] </p>\r\n      </li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>Unless  specified differently in this guideline,  institutions must not take account of physical or financial collateral, guarantees or other credit risk mitigation  techniques to reduce the exposure measure.\r\n    <p class="align-right">[BCBS Jan 2014 par 13] </p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>An institution\xe2\x80\x99s  total exposure measure is the sum of the following exposures: (a) on-balance  sheet exposures; (b) derivative exposures; (c) securities financing transaction  (SFT) exposures; and (d) off-balance sheet (OBS) items. The specific treatments  for these four main exposure types are defined below.\r\n    <p class="align-right">[BCBS Jan 2014  par 14]</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h3 id="a"><em>(a) On balance sheet exposures</em></h3>\r\n<ol start="14">\r\n  <li>Institutions must  include all balance sheet  assets in their exposure measure, including on-balance sheet derivatives  collateral and collateral for SFTs, with the exception of on-balance sheet  derivative and SFT assets that are covered in paragraphs 21 to\xc2\xa056 below.\r\n    <p class="align-right">[BCBS Jan 2014 par 15]</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>However,  to ensure consistency, balance sheet assets deducted from Tier 1 capital (as  set out in section 2.3 of the CAR Guideline) may be deducted from the exposure  measure. Two examples follow:\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li>Where  a banking, financial or insurance entity is not included in the regulatory  scope of consolidation as set out in paragraph 4  of this guideline, the  amount of any investment in the capital of that entity that is totally or  partially deducted from CET1 capital or from Additional Tier 1 capital of the institution  following the corresponding deduction approach in paragraphs 70 to 78 of  Chapter 2 of the CAR Guideline must also be deducted from the exposure measure.</li>\r\n      <li>For  institutions using the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach to determining  capital requirements for credit risk, paragraph 57 of Chapter 2 of the CAR  Guideline requires any shortfall in the stock of eligible provisions relative  to expected losses to be deducted from CET1 capital. The same amount must be  deducted from the exposure measure.\r\n        <p class="align-right">[BCBS Jan 2014 par 16]</p>\r\n      </li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>Liability items must  not be deducted from the measure of exposure. For example, gains/losses on fair  valued liabilities or accounting valuation adjustments on derivative  liabilities due to changes in the institution\xe2\x80\x99s own credit risk as described in  paragraph 59 of the Chapter 2 of the CAR Guideline must  not be deducted from the exposure measure.\r\n    <p class="align-right">[BCBS Jan 2014 par 17]</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li><p>Securitization exposures which are not  derecognized or which are not exempted from consolidation under applicable  accounting standards (e.g., IFRS) should be included in the exposure measure<sup id="fnb7-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb7"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>7</a></sup>.  Furthermore, irrespective of the accounting standards\xe2\x80\x99 determination of what is  on the balance sheet, the exposure measure should reflect the originator\xe2\x80\x99s  exposure as a result of the securitization. Where the originator\xe2\x80\x99s balance  sheet exposure is not deemed to be materially reduced by the securitization,  inclusion in the exposure measure may be appropriate, irrespective of the  accounting treatment.</p></li>\r\n  <li>OSFI is generally of the view that where  derecognition is achieved as a result of the institution demonstrating to its auditors  that substantially all of the risks and rewards have been transferred under IFRS,  exclusion from the exposure measure is appropriate unless other exceptional  circumstances exist. Where it is not evident that substantially all of the risks  and rewards have been transferred and the derecognition test is passed based on  the seller demonstrating that control of the asset has been relinquished, an  institution will be expected to include derecognized assets in the exposure  measure unless otherwise instructed by OSFI, following a case-specific  assessment of the institution\xe2\x80\x99s submission indicating how its balance sheet  risks have been materially reduced.\r\n  <p><em>Specific cases where OSFI guidance has been provided</em></p>\r\n </li>\r\n  <li>In the case of mortgage whole  loan sale transactions having the following characteristics, the balance sheet exposure will be considered to be substantially reduced and the institution will not be required to include sold loans in the exposure measure. <br />\r\n  </li>\r\n  <ol class="list-lower-alpha">\r\n    <li>The mortgages are insured by CMHC or a private  insurer recognized by the <em>Protection of  Residential Mortgage or Hypothecary Insurance Act</em>;</li>\r\n    <li>The institution has retained the option, not the  obligation to repurchase the mortgages at par from the investor at the end of  their contractual term.;</li>\r\n    <li>The institution may continue to administer and  service mortgages for the investor following the sale but the institution is  not obligated to advance uncollected mortgage payments on account of delinquent  or defaulted mortgages; and</li>\r\n    <li>The investor has the right to sell the mortgages  to a third party at any time. </li>\r\n  </ol>\r\n  <li>Mortgage insured as per paragraph 19(a)  above for their whole life, that have been pooled and sold as <em>National Housing Act</em> Mortgage Backed  Securities (NHA MBS or NHA MBS Program) and derecognized under IFRS following a  transaction with a third party with respect to the institution\xe2\x80\x99s retained  interest in any excess spread, can be excluded from the exposure measure. Such  exclusion is subject to the institution obtaining written confirmation from  CMHC that CMHC does not object to the institution proceeding with such a  transaction or similar transactions. However, recognizing the potential  liquidity constraints imposed by the NHA MBS Program on institutions in a  stressed environment, institutions must be able to demonstrate alignment with  OSFI\xe2\x80\x99s B-6 Liquidity Guideline, Liquidity Adequacy Requirements Guideline, and  other liquidity requirements as necessary and/or specified by OSFI. This  includes institutions having in place appropriate liquidity plans that  demonstrate the management of liquidity risks, including an appropriate  laddering of the scheduled maturities for all outstanding NHA MBS and on-going  tracking of cash flows against those plans.\xc2\xa0 </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 id="b"><em>(b) Derivative exposures</em></h3>\r\n<h4 id="bi"><em>(i) Treatment of derivatives</em></h4>\r\n<ol start="21">\r\n  <li>Derivatives  create two types of exposure: (a) an exposure arising from the underlying of  the derivative contract; and (b) a counterparty credit risk (CCR) exposure.

For single-name credit derivatives, protection purchased that  references a subordinated position may offset protection sold on a more senior  position of the same reference entity as long as a credit event on the senior  reference asset would result in a credit event on the subordinated reference  asset. Protection purchased on a pool of reference entities may offset  protection sold on individual reference names if the protection purchased is  economically equivalent to buying protection separately on each of the  individual names in the pool (this would, for example, be the case if an  institution were to purchase protection on an entire securitisation structure).  If an institution purchases protection on a pool of reference names, but the  credit protection does not cover the entire pool (i.e., the protection covers  only a subset of the pool, as in the case of an nth-to-default credit  derivative or a securitisation tranche), then offsetting is not permitted for  the protection sold on individual reference names. However, such purchased  protections may offset sold protections on a pool provided the purchased  protection covers the entirety of the subset of the pool on which protection  has been sold. In other words, offsetting may only be recognised when the pool  of reference entities and the level of subordination in both transactions are  identical.\r\n    <p class="align-right">[BCBS Jan 2014 par 30 footnote 14]</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>In paragraph 45 above, the effective notional amount of a written credit derivative may  be reduced by any negative change in fair value reflected in the institution\xe2\x80\x99s  Tier 1 capital provided the effective notional amount of the offsetting  purchased credit protection is also reduced by any resulting positive change in  fair value reflected in Tier 1 capital<sup id="fnb28-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fnb28"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>28</a></sup>.
